# Source of Truth Law

All canonical determinations must originate from constitutionally recognized
source-of-truth datasets.

Only the following may serve as canonical sources of truth:
- Execution Engine records
- Audit records
- Judicial determinations
- Amendment registry records

No derived, cached, simulated, or AI-generated dataset may be treated as
source of truth.
