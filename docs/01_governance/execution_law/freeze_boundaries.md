# Freeze Boundaries

The XC-Ecosystem is partitioned into constitutional freeze layers:

| Layer | Freeze Point |
|------|-------------|
| H0 | End of current execution window |
| H1 | End of current season |
| H2 | End of recruiting cycle |
| H3 | End of academic year |

All finalized records that cross a freeze boundary become immutable.
