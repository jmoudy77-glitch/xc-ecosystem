# Judicial Authority Law

Judicial Authority governs the evaluation of disputes, appeals, and procedural
claims arising from canonical system determinations.

Judicial Authority is vested in:
- Appeals Engine
- Compliance Review Engine

Judicial layers may:
- review finalized determinations
- issue prospective remedies
- confirm or deny appeals

Judicial layers may never retroactively mutate canonical records.
