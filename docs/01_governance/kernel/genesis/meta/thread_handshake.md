# Thread Handshake

Every new thread must declare:

- Active runtime:
- Objective:
- Authoritative files (paths):

The assistant must:
1) acknowledge active runtime + objective
2) operate only from authoritative files (plus any explicitly provided)
3) emit promotions only as single atomic Codex-executable plaintext streams
