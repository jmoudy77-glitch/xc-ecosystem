# Kernel Canon
## Cross-Runtime Alignment: Program Health ↔ Performance Balance

---

## Article K-I — Alignment Authority

This canon establishes the authoritative semantic alignment between:
- Program Health Runtime
- Performance Runtime

No runtime may diverge in balance semantics once aligned herein.

This document derives authority from the Kernel Constitution and binds both runtimes equally.

---

## Article K-II — Shared Balance Ontology

The following concepts are declared **kernel-shared primitives**:

1. Balance
2. Imbalance
3. Directional Tension
4. Volatility
5. Equilibrium Reference

These primitives must carry identical meaning across aligned runtimes.

---

## Article K-III — Equilibrium Reference Law

Both runtimes MUST define equilibrium as:

- A neutral reference plane
- Signed deviation from that plane
- Zero displacement indicates balance

No runtime may redefine equilibrium independently.

---

## Article K-IV — Directional Semantics Law

Directional imbalance semantics are unified as follows:

- Positive displacement = ABOVE equilibrium
- Negative displacement = BELOW equilibrium

Above/Below semantics must remain directionally consistent across:
- Volumetric instruments
- Glyph summaries
- Diagnostics

No runtime may invert or reinterpret direction.

---

## Article K-V — Volatility Alignment Law

Volatility is a shared categorical qualifier defined as:

- STABLE
- SHIFTING
- SPIKING

Volatility:
- May be derived from recent canonical samples
- Must remain categorical
- Must never render as a historical chart in summary surfaces

Both runtimes must apply identical volatility derivation windows (W).

---

## Article K-VI — Glyph Architecture Alignment

The Program Health glyph bar architecture is declared the canonical structural pattern for balance summaries.

Performance Runtime glyphs:
- MUST reuse this architecture structurally
- MUST derive data independently from Performance canonical states
- MUST NOT import Program Health data directly

Architecture is shared; data is not.

---

## Article K-VII — Derivation Boundary Law

No runtime may:
- Derive balance state from another runtime’s glyph
- Bypass its own canonical state emission

Cross-runtime insight must be achieved only through:
- Canonical event consumption
- Promoted derivation rules

---

## Article K-VIII — Diagnostic Consistency Law

Any diagnostic surface that aggregates or compares Program Health and Performance MUST:

- Preserve directional semantics
- Preserve equilibrium reference
- Declare runtime source for each signal

No blended or averaged balance states are permitted without explicit promotion.

---

## Article K-IX — Drift Classification (Cross-Runtime)

If identical entities (e.g., program, season) exhibit:
- Opposing balance direction
- Incompatible volatility classification

across aligned runtimes without causal explanation, this is classified as **Cross-Runtime Semantic Drift**.

Such drift must:
- Be logged
- Be auditable
- Be resolved only via promotion or causal reconciliation

---

## Canonical Summary

- Balance semantics are kernel-shared
- Architecture may be reused, data may not
- Equilibrium and direction are immutable
- Cross-runtime drift is a first-class defect
