# CANVAS II — PERFORMANCE RUNTIME CONSTITUTION

## Sovereign Reality Law for the XC-Ecosystem

---

## Article P-I — Performance Runtime Ontology & Canonical State

### P-I.1 — Definition of the Performance Runtime

The Performance Runtime is the sovereign reality surface of the XC-Ecosystem.

It is the canonical environment in which all athletic, academic, physiological, behavioral, and compliance states of an athlete or program exist as truth within the system.

No representation, visualization, forecast, recommendation, or interface may define or alter reality.  
Reality exists only inside the Performance Runtime.

---

### P-I.2 — Canonical State

A Canonical State is the complete, authoritative, time-bound truth of an entity at a specific instant.

A canonical state:
• Is singular  
• Is ledger-anchored  
• Is causally attributable  
• Is immutable once emitted  
• Is discoverable but never overwritten  

All truth in the XC-Ecosystem exists as a sequence of canonical states.

---

### P-I.3 — State Lineage

Every canonical state must have an explicit causal parent.

No state may exist without lineage.  
No lineage may be fabricated.  
No future state may be emitted without an anchored present state.

This establishes a total, continuous, irreversible state chain for every athlete, program, and governed entity.

---

### P-I.4 — Reality vs. Representation

The Performance Runtime is reality.  
Dashboards, analytics, scores, reports, UI, AI, forecasts, projections, and interfaces are representations.

Representations:
• May observe  
• May summarize  
• May transform  
• May never define  
• May never rewrite  
• May never bypass canonical state  

---

### P-I.5 — Immutability Law

Once emitted, a canonical state is permanently true.

Errors are corrected only through the emission of subsequent canonical states, never by mutation of historical truth.

History is law.

---

### P-I.6 — Temporal Sovereignty

All canonical states are time-sovereign.

Time is:
• Monotonic  
• Unidirectional  
• Globally ordered per entity  
• Ledger-sealed  

No state may be back-dated, forward-dated, or reordered.

---

### P-I.7 — Reality Surface

The Performance Runtime defines the system’s Reality Surface.

Any computation, intelligence, automation, decisioning, billing, eligibility logic, recruiting logic, compliance judgment, scholarship calculus, or enforcement mechanism must bind to canonical state as its sole source of truth.

---

## Article P-II — Canonical Event Emission & State Formation Law

### P-II.1 — Canonical Events

A Canonical Event is the sole lawful mechanism by which reality may change inside the Performance Runtime.

No state may be formed, altered, corrected, advanced, or retired except by canonical event emission.

There are no updates.  
There are only events.

---

### P-II.2 — Event Sovereignty

A canonical event is:
• Causally attributable  
• Time-anchored  
• Ledger-sealed  
• Entity-bound  
• Irreversible  
• Non-simulatable  
• Non-fabricable  

Once emitted, an event becomes permanent law.

---

### P-II.3 — State Formation

A Canonical State is always the deterministic consequence of one or more canonical events.

States are derived.  
Events are sovereign.

No state may exist without its generating event chain.

---

### P-II.4 — Deterministic Formation

Given the same canonical event sequence, the resulting canonical state must always be identical.

There may be no nondeterminism, stochastic mutation, heuristic drift, or AI influence in state formation.

Reality is deterministic.

---

### P-II.5 — Forward-Only Correction

All correction is performed by additional events.

No canonical event may be edited.  
No canonical state may be rewritten.  
No historical truth may be altered.

Error is corrected by superseding truth, not rewriting truth.

---

### P-II.6 — Event Classes

Canonical events must be explicitly typed and classed.

At minimum, canonical event classes shall include:
• Measurement  
• Validation  
• Qualification  
• Compliance  
• Performance  
• Health  
• Eligibility  
• Administrative  
• Financial  
• Authority  
• Structural  

No untyped or implicit events may exist.

---

### P-II.7 — Causal Attribution

Every canonical event must declare:
• An actor  
• A cause  
• A target  
• A scope  
• A lawful authority surface  

No anonymous events may exist.

---

### P-II.8 — Runtime Binding

All computation, analytics, AI inference, automation, UI projection, billing enforcement, eligibility logic, recruiting logic, and compliance judgment must bind exclusively to canonical state derived from canonical events.

There is no other lawful truth surface.

---

## Article P-III — Runtime Identity, Entity Sovereignty & Reality Partitioning

### P-III.1 — Runtime Identity

Each Performance Runtime is a sovereign reality domain.

A runtime possesses:
• A unique runtime identity  
• A sealed canonical ledger  
• Independent temporal ordering  
• Independent state chains  

No two runtimes may share state, lineage, or event streams.

---

### P-III.2 — Entity Sovereignty

Every athlete, program, team, season, and governed system object constitutes a sovereign entity inside a runtime.

Entities possess:
• Independent canonical state chains  
• Independent causal lineage  
• Independent temporal continuity  

No entity may write, alter, or emit reality on behalf of another entity without explicit lawful authority.

---

### P-III.3 — Reality Partitioning

Reality is partitioned by runtime boundaries.

No canonical state, event, or lineage may cross runtime boundaries.

All cross-domain influence must occur only through lawful, non-canonical representations.

---

### P-III.4 — Partition Integrity

No computation, automation, AI, integration, or interface may bypass runtime partitions.

Partition violation constitutes a corruption event.

---

### P-III.5 — External Systems

External platforms, sensors, integrations, partners, and services are non-canonical.

They may emit candidate inputs, but only the Performance Runtime may emit canonical events.

---

### P-III.6 — Runtime Exclusivity

No alternative reality surface may exist.

All truth inside the XC-Ecosystem must be bound to exactly one Performance Runtime.

---

## Article P-IV — Authority Surfaces & Lawful Causation

### P-IV.1 — Authority Surfaces

All canonical event emission must occur through a lawful authority surface.

An authority surface is the formally recognized source of causation permitted to alter reality.

---

### P-IV.2 — Authority Classes

Authority surfaces shall be explicitly classed, including at minimum:
• Athlete  
• Coach  
• Program  
• Institution  
• Governing Body  
• Medical  
• Compliance  
• Financial  
• System  

No unclassed authority may emit canonical events.

---

### P-IV.3 — Lawful Causation

A canonical event is lawful only if:
• The emitting authority surface is valid  
• The authority class permits the event class  
• The target entity is within scope  
• The causal chain is intact  

Unlawful causation is void.

---

### P-IV.4 — Authority Scope

Authority is scope-bound.

No authority may emit events outside its explicit jurisdiction.

---

### P-IV.5 — Authority Revocation

Authority may be granted, limited, suspended, or revoked only through canonical events.

---

### P-IV.6 — System Authority

System-level authority exists solely to preserve runtime integrity, survivability, and law enforcement.

It may not fabricate, simulate, or invent reality.

---

## Article P-V — Measurement, Evidence & Truth Qualification

### P-V.1 — Measurement

All canonical performance, health, readiness, academic, and compliance facts must originate as measurements.

Measurements are observational claims, not reality, until qualified.

---

### P-V.2 — Evidence Qualification

A measurement becomes canonical only through evidence qualification.

Qualification requires:
• A valid authority surface  
• An accepted measurement class  
• Verifiable provenance  
• Time anchoring  
• Scope legitimacy  

---

### P-V.3 — Truth Admission

Only qualified evidence may be admitted as canonical events.

Unqualified measurements are non-canonical and may not alter reality.

---

### P-V.4 — Evidence Lineage

All canonical truth must retain full measurement provenance and evidence lineage.

No anonymous truth may exist.

---

### P-V.5 — Dispute and Reconciliation

Disputed evidence may only be resolved through canonical corrective events.

Truth is superseded, not erased.

---

## Article P-VI — Temporal Semantics & Horizon Law

### P-VI.1 — Temporal Semantics

All canonical states and events are bound to temporal meaning.

Time is not metadata.  
Time is reality context.

---

### P-VI.2 — Horizon Domains

Every canonical state must declare its horizon domain, including at minimum:
• Present  
• Near-Term  
• Mid-Term  
• Long-Term  

Horizon domains define truth relevance windows.

---

### P-VI.3 — Horizon Law

Future-horizon states are projections until qualified by canonical events.

Only present-horizon states are fully binding.

---

### P-VI.4 — Temporal Decay

All horizon truth decays forward into the present only by canonical events.

---

### P-VI.5 — Backward Sealing

No future-horizon state may retroactively alter present or historical truth.

---

## Article P-VII — Determinism, Computation & AI Subordination

### P-VII.1 — Determinism

Canonical state formation is strictly deterministic.

No stochastic, heuristic, probabilistic, or learning-based process may directly alter canonical state.

---

### P-VII.2 — Computation Boundaries

All computation must bind to canonical state as read-only truth.

No computation may emit canonical events unless lawfully authorized.

---

### P-VII.3 — AI Subordination

AI systems are non-canonical observers.

They may infer, predict, summarize, recommend, and simulate — but may not define, alter, or emit reality.

---

### P-VII.4 — Simulation Prohibition

No simulated, inferred, or hypothetical state may be admitted as canonical truth.

---

## Article P-VIII — Survivability, Corruption Resistance & Continuity

### P-VIII.1 — Survivability

The Performance Runtime must remain causally intact across failure, migration, scaling, partitioning, and restoration.

No failure may break canonical lineage.

---

### P-VIII.2 — Corruption Resistance

Any mutation, deletion, injection, reordering, or fabrication of canonical events or state constitutes corruption.

Corruption must be detectable, isolatable, and survivable.

---

### P-VIII.3 — Continuity

Runtime continuity must be provable across time.

No reality gap may exist.

---

### P-VIII.4 — Recovery Law

All recovery operations must preserve canonical order and causal lineage.

---

## Article P-IX — Runtime Creation, Sealing & Runtime Sovereignty

### P-IX.1 — Runtime Creation

A Performance Runtime is created only through a canonical runtime-creation event.

No implicit, derived, or simulated runtime may exist.

---

### P-IX.2 — Sealing

Upon creation, a runtime must be sealed.

Sealing establishes:
• Ledger immutability  
• Temporal ordering  
• Authority surfaces  
• Partition boundaries  
• Survivability guarantees  

An unsealed runtime is void.

---

### P-IX.3 — Runtime Sovereignty

A sealed runtime is a sovereign reality domain.

No external system, automation, AI, interface, or administrator may override, rewrite, or bypass its canonical law.

---

### P-IX.4 — Lawful Evolution

Runtime schema, authority structures, and enforcement logic may evolve only through canonical structural events.

Evolution may extend law but may not violate prior canonical truth.

---

### P-IX.5 — Runtime Finality

The Performance Runtime Constitution is binding on all present and future system modules.

No feature, service, integration, or intelligence may exist outside its law.

---

## Article P-X — Survivability Envelope & Balance Instrument Law

### P-X.1 — Balance Instrument Definition

The Balance Instrument is the sovereign survivability cockpit of the XC-Ecosystem.

It is the sole lawful instrument authorized to:
• Evaluate system survivability stability  
• Detect structural instability  
• Declare envelope breach  
• Issue intervention authority  
• Govern execution remediation across runtimes  

No dashboard, score, report, or analytics surface may perform these functions.

---

### P-X.2 — Survivability Envelope

The Survivability Envelope is the constitutional operational boundary within which a program, team, or athlete may lawfully execute.

It defines:
• Upper survivability bounds  
• Lower survivability bounds  
• Stability corridors  
• Drift trajectories  
• Collapse thresholds  

Crossing survivability bounds constitutes structural instability, not poor performance.

---

### P-X.3 — Structural Instability

Structural instability exists when canonical state crosses survivability envelope bounds in any survivability plane.

Instability is:
• A legal system state  
• A causal trigger  
• An enforcement condition  

Instability is not descriptive — it is actionable law.

---

### P-X.4 — Survivability Planes

At minimum, survivability planes include:
• Mental  
• Physical  
• Tactical  
• Cultural  

Each plane is independently evaluated and may independently trigger instability.

---

### P-X.5 — Continuous Evaluation

The Balance Instrument operates continuously.

It must:
• Re-evaluate canonical state in real time  
• Maintain drift trajectory  
• Project near-term survivability decay  
• Maintain envelope-breach prediction  

---

### P-X.6 — Intervention Authority

When instability exists or is projected, the Balance Instrument must issue intervention authority events that:
• Constrain Training Runtime execution  
• Trigger Recruiting remediation  
• Trigger Program Health escalation  
• Trigger Cultural or Compliance remediation  
• Restrict execution envelopes  

These are not recommendations.  
They are lawful system commands.

---

### P-X.7 — Runtime Subordination

All runtimes subordinate to Performance (Training, Recruiting, Program Health, Culture, Compliance, and others) are legally bound to obey Balance Instrument intervention authority.

No runtime may override or ignore intervention authority.

---

### P-X.8 — Predictive Breach Law

Projected envelope breach constitutes pre-instability.

Pre-instability must be treated as legally actionable survivability risk.

---

### P-X.9 — Breach Recovery

Recovery from instability must:
• Emit corrective canonical events  
• Restore envelope compliance  
• Prove causal restoration  

No cosmetic or representational recovery is valid.

---

### P-X.10 — Survivability Supremacy

The Balance Instrument is the supreme survivability authority of the XC-Ecosystem.

No planning, recruiting, training, compliance, or analytics system may supersede survivability law.
