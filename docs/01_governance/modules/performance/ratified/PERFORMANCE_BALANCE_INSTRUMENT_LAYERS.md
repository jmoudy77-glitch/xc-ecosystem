# Performance Balance Instrument
## Layered Interaction & Permission Canon

---

## Article B-I — Instrument Layer Model

The Performance Balance Instrument is governed by a strict three-layer interaction model.

Each layer has:
- A single purpose
- Explicit permissions
- Explicit prohibitions

No layer may assume the responsibilities of another.

## Layer 1 — Volumetric Context Layer  
(3D Balance Plane + Seismograph Volume)

### Purpose
To provide relational, systemic, and temporal context across all balance dichotomies simultaneously.

### Canonical Characteristics
- Three-dimensional
- Volumetric
- Continuous
- Non-quantized
- Orientation-dependent

### Permissions
- View-only rendering
- Free orbital rotation (360°)
- Snap-to-projection when near canonical orientations
- Passive animation

### Explicit Prohibitions
- No direct interaction
- No hover states
- No click targets
- No selection
- No data inspection
- No overlays
- No labels beyond semantic anchors

### Interaction Law
Orientation changes projection, not state.

## Layer 2 — Projected Analysis Layer  
(Snapped End-On / Side-On Views)

### Purpose
To provide focused analytical clarity by projecting the volumetric model into a two-dimensional analytical surface.

### Permissions
- Temporal scrubbing (discrete steps only)
- Dimension cycling (one dichotomy at a time)
- Snapshot stepping
- Contextual overlays
- Aggregate summaries (snapshot mode only)

### Explicit Prohibitions
- No freeform rotation
- No multi-dimension interaction
- No data mutation
- No cross-layer authority

### Projection Rules
- End-On Projection: single temporal snapshot, all dichotomies visible
- Side-On Projection: single dichotomy over time

Time and dimension controls are mutually exclusive by projection.

## Layer 3 — Summary Glyph Layer  
(Program Health–Derived Balance Glyph)

### Purpose
To provide a reactionary, glanceable verdict of system balance.

### Permissions
- Passive display
- Visual derivation from underlying model
- Invocation of the Balance Instrument

### Explicit Prohibitions
- No independent computation
- No temporal history
- No manipulation
- No authority over model interpretation

### Authority Rule
The glyph is always downstream of the Balance Instrument.

## Article B-II — Cross-Layer Authority Law

1. Single Source of Truth: Volumetric model defines reality.
2. Unidirectional Derivation: Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3 only.
3. Interaction Escalation Rule: Observation → Analysis → Action.

## Article B-III — Coach Cognition Safeguard

At no point may the system:
- Require interaction to understand relationships
- Imply action where none is available
- Obscure whether a view is observational or analytical
