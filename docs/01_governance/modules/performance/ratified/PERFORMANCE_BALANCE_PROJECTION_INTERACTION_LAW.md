# Performance Balance Instrument
## Projection Interaction Law

---

## Article B-IV — Projection Authority

All interaction with the Performance Balance Instrument is governed exclusively through projection states derived from the Volumetric Context Layer.

No interaction may occur in volumetric form.

---

## Article B-V — Canonical Projection States

Exactly two projection states are authorized:

1. End-On Projection (Snapshot Mode)
2. Side-On Projection (Temporal Mode)

No additional projection states are permitted.

---

## Article B-VI — Snap Threshold Law

Projection snap occurs when orientation enters a canonical threshold:

- End-On Snap:
  - View vector aligns within ±7° of the balance plane normal
- Side-On Snap:
  - View vector aligns within ±7° of the balance plane tangent

Upon snap:
- Volumetric rendering is suppressed
- Projection rendering is activated
- Interaction permissions are enabled

Exiting threshold restores Volumetric Context Layer and disables interaction.

## Article B-VII — End-On Projection Law (Snapshot Mode)

### Purpose
To analyze the full set of balance dichotomies at a single point in time.

### Characteristics
- All dichotomies rendered simultaneously
- Projection represents a single temporal index
- Earliest render defaults to most recent canonical time

### Permissions
- Scroll wheel: advance temporal index forward/backward
- Discrete step only (no continuous scrubbing)
- Contextual aggregate overlay permitted

### Prohibitions
- No dichotomy isolation
- No dimension cycling
- No temporal interpolation
- No data mutation

---

## Article B-VIII — Side-On Projection Law (Temporal Mode)

### Purpose
To analyze a single balance dichotomy across time.

### Characteristics
- One dichotomy rendered
- Timeline rendered left-to-right
- Full temporal span permitted

### Permissions
- Scroll wheel: cycle dichotomy forward/backward
- Discrete dichotomy step only
- Contextual point overlay permitted

### Prohibitions
- No temporal scrubbing
- No multi-dichotomy rendering
- No temporal interpolation
- No data mutation

---

## Article B-IX — Mutual Exclusivity Law

Time navigation and dichotomy navigation are mutually exclusive.

- End-On Projection: time is navigable, dichotomy is fixed
- Side-On Projection: dichotomy is navigable, time is fixed

Any UI that violates this exclusivity is non-canonical.

---

## Article B-X — Overlay Law

Overlays may only appear in projection states.

Overlay constraints:
- Non-obstructive
- Plain-language
- Non-quantitative
- Ephemeral

Overlays may summarize but may not expose raw values.

---

## Article B-XI — Restoration Law

When exiting projection snap:
- All overlays are dismissed
- Interaction permissions are revoked
- Instrument returns to Volumetric Context Layer

No projection state may persist without explicit orientation alignment.

---

## Canonical Summary

- Orientation determines authority
- Projection enables interaction
- Volumetric state is observational only
- Interaction scope is strictly bounded
