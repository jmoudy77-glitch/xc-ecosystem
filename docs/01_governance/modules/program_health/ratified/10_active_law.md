Exclusion rule:
- Articles XIV–XXIII (Execution Integrity Constitution) are excluded from the Program Health module baseline and must live in the global kernel governance law.
- Included in this module baseline: Articles I–XIII and XXIV–XXIX.

# EcoSport — Program Health — Active Law

*(Founding draft)*

## Article I

Program Health is not a dashboard; it is an analytical engine display instrument.

## Article II

Program Health must never adopt dashboard-style features; it must retain its instrument form, navigability, and visual feedback functions within a single unified instrument.

## Article III

Drill-down analysis must be limited to a single layer of depth and must never leave the instrument context.

## Article IV

Program Health must never contain “panels” of metrics, cards arranged as a grid dashboard, stacked charts, or a “settings panel” inside the instrument.

## Article V

Program Health must never create a companion “analytics” or “insights” view outside the instrument; all analysis must remain within the instrument.

## Article VI — Non-Executive Forecasting

Program Health may forecast or suggest future promotions, but it must never imply that it executes change automatically or has autonomous authority to modify runtime state.

## Article VII — Canonical Supremacy

Truth-bearing data must be canonical and explicitly sourced. Non-canonical inferences must be labeled.

## Article VIII — No Retroactive Influence

No output may imply retroactive influence over runtime state. Representation is not authority.

## Article IX — Pressure-Form Output

All output must preserve pressure semantics: tension, void, recovery, drift. Aesthetic must remain subordinate to meaning.

## Article X — A2 Visual Field Jurisdiction

All instrument visuals must be contained within the Program Health plane; no detached overlays may serve as companion dashboards.

## Article XI — Instrument Shape Sovereignty

The instrument’s geometry and interpretive model are sovereign; features must conform to the instrument, not reshape it into a dashboard.

## Article XII — Single Instrument Plane

There is one unified field plane; no slab/card/panel ecology may exist inside the field plane.

## Article XIII — Cognitive Load Budget

The instrument must preserve a strict cognitive load budget. Additional layers must be denied unless constitutionally amended.

*(Draft — to be ratified)*

## Article XXIV — Locality of Change

Any promotion must explicitly declare its intended blast radius (files, components, systems affected). No promotion may modify undeclared surfaces.

## Article XXV — Visual Causality Preservation

Visual effects, animations, and spatial behaviors must preserve causal readability; they must not obscure structural meaning, lineage flow, or pressure semantics.

## Article XXVI — Doctrine Consistency Firewall

New features, components, or workflows must be demonstrably doctrine-consistent; anything doctrine-expanding must be introduced only via explicit constitutional amendment.

## Article XXVII — Causal Traceability Guarantee

Every visible change must be traceable to a causal event, proof source, or promotion. No silent shifts.

## Article XXVIII — No Silent Behavioral Change

Behavioral changes must be explicit. Hidden changes are constitutional violations.

## Article XXIX — Single Interpretive Model

The instrument must preserve a single interpretive model. No dual metaphors, no competing readings.
