# Program Health UI v1 Constitution

**Status:** Ratified — Locked for implementation

This constitution freezes the v1 Program Health UI execution contract so future threads do not redesign, drift, or degrade the instrument into a dashboard ecology.

---

## 1) Doctrine

Program Health is an instrument, not a dashboard. It renders structural truth under pressure: absences, redundancies, certifications, authority boundaries, and drift, as a single unified analytic field.

The UI must preserve:
- **Visual causality**
- **Single interpretive model**
- **Low cognitive load**
- **Coach-legible semantics**
- **Truth-bearing presentation**

---

## 2) Structural Layout Contract

The Program Health instrument is composed of:

### 2.1 Structural Status Banner
- Anchors the instrument.
- States current runtime state: snapshot time, runtime id, and integrity status.
- Must remain light, compact, and non-dashboard.

### 2.2 Capability Drift Map (Primary Field)
- The central instrument plane.
- Shows sector tension distribution and drift.
- Must be rotatable / interactive within a single plane.
- Must never become a “chart dashboard.”

### 2.3 Absence Register (Secondary Field Surface)
- A compact list of absence void determinations.
- Cards are minimal; no panels.
- Selects one determination to open Health Brief.

### 2.4 Health Brief (Single-layer Drilldown)
- Only one layer deep.
- Lives inside the instrument context.
- Displays: Determination, lineage, proof, and suggested repair actions.
- Must not become a multi-page analytical surface.

---

## 3) Interaction Contract

- Hover reveals; click confirms.
- Active sector selection is reversible.
- All actions must preserve “where you are” and “what will happen.”
- No interaction may cause the user to leave the instrument.

---

## 4) Visual Semantics

### 4.1 Drift Map Semantics
- Sectors represent capability domains.
- Radial distribution expresses tension / drift.
- The read-ray is the interpretive spine.

### 4.2 Absence Semantics
- Absence voids are structural holes in the capability lattice.
- Absence cards must read as “void determinations,” not tasks.

### 4.3 Truth View
- Proof and lineage are canonical or explicitly marked as inference.
- The system must never imply authority it does not possess.

---

## 5) Implementation Contract

- No slab/card/panel ecology inside the field plane.
- No companion dashboard surfaces.
- No detached “analytics pages.”
- Instrument must preserve a single interpretive model.

---

## 6) Completion Criteria (v1)

v1 is complete when:

- Drift Map renders a stable read-ray + sector field.
- Absence Register renders determinations with minimal cards.
- Health Brief opens inside the instrument and displays proof/lineage.
- All surfaces remain within the single instrument context.

This constitution is ratified and locked.
