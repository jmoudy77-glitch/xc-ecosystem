PROGRAM HEALTH RUNTIME CONSTITUTION

First Edition

⸻

Article I — Sovereignty & Scope
	1.	The Program Health Runtime is a sovereign runtime within XC-Ecosystem.
	2.	It governs:
	•	A1/A2 absence detection engines
	•	Capability vs survivability evaluation
	•	Horizon ring (H0–H3) evaluation planes
	•	Canonical disc topology & wedge mapping
	•	Program Health canonical event emission
	•	Program Health causal chains feeding Recruiting and Performance

⸻

Article II — Canon Surfaces

The following canon surfaces define Program Health law:
	•	/docs/01_governance/modules/program_health/ratified/*
	•	/docs/04_operational_modules/program_health/*
	•	/docs/03_domain_models/program_health/*
	•	/docs/01_governance/promotions/PROGRAM_HEALTH_LEDGER.md

These are the only authoritative Program Health documentation planes.

⸻

Article III — Module Boundary Law (Option A)
	1.	All Program Health domain behavior must live under:
lib/modules/program_health/...
	2.	Program Health HTTP route handlers (/app/api/program_health/...) are adapters only.
	3.	Program Health server actions may not contain business logic — they must delegate to lib/modules/program_health.

⸻

Article IV — Disc Topology Law
	1.	The Program Health Disc is constitutionally locked.
	2.	The Disc is the sole canonical visualization of program survivability and capability drift.
	3.	Disc wedges, horizon rings (H0–H3), and hole topology represent canonical state, not UI ornamentation.
	4.	All Program Health evaluation outputs must map deterministically into Disc topology.

⸻

Article V — Absence Engine Law
	1.	A1 Absence Engine governs survivability state.
	2.	A2 Absence Engine governs capability degradation.
	3.	Absence engines emit canonical events into the Genesis event plane.
	4.	Absence engine outputs are upstream of Recruiting and Performance causal chains.

⸻

Article VI — Promotion & Ledger Law
	1.	All Program Health canon changes must be recorded in:
	/docs/01_governance/promotions/PROGRAM_HEALTH_LEDGER.md
	2.	Program Health promotions may not be bundled with non–Program Health canon changes.
	3.	All schema, routing, and behavioral changes must follow the Triple-Lock Rule:
	•	Canon update
	•	Migration
	•	Ledger entry

⸻

Article VII — UI Invariants
	1.	The Disc UI is constitutionally locked:
	•	Radial disc with canonical wedges
	•	Horizon ring overlays (H0–H3)
	•	Absence holes as primary survivability indicators
	•	Minimal-touch cognitive design
	2.	No Program Health UI may violate disc topology mapping rules.

⸻

Article VIII — Drift Prevention Law
	1.	No Program Health domain logic may exist outside lib/modules/program_health.
	2.	No Program Health canon may exist outside /docs.
	3.	Derived artifacts have no canonical authority.

⸻

Article IX — Ratification

This Constitution is effective immediately upon publication in its Constitution Thread and governs all Program Health development henceforth.
