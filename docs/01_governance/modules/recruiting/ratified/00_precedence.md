# Recruiting Governance — Precedence

## 1) Binding scope
This folder contains ratified Recruiting module law. It is binding for all Recruiting UI, AI, and data interfaces.

## 2) Authority ordering
- Program Health is the canonical diagnostic authority for absence classification and envelope constraints.
- Recruiting is an operational module that consumes Program Health canonical outputs and governs coach-facing recruiting workflows.
- Bidirectional data flow between Program Health and Recruiting does not imply shared diagnostic authority.

## 3) Non-conflict rule
If any Recruiting document conflicts with Kernel or Program Health ratified law, the Kernel and Program Health law prevail.
