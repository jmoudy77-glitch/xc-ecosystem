# RECRUITING M3 — CONSTRAINT-TYPE CONTRIBUTION RULES CANON
## Coverage, Redundancy, Authority, Certification Semantics

---

### Article M3-CT-I — Purpose

This canon defines the **exclusive rules** by which Recruiting M3 may model candidate contributions across different **Program Health constraint types**.

Its purpose is to ensure that each constraint type preserves its distinct semantics and that no contribution is inferred, substituted, or overstated across constraint boundaries.

---

### Article M3-CT-II — Constraint-Type Separation (Non-Negotiable)

Each constraint type is **semantically independent**.

Rules for one constraint type may not be reused, inferred, or analogized for another.

Constraint types:
- Coverage
- Redundancy
- Authority
- Certification

---

### Article M3-CT-III — Coverage Contribution Rules

**Definition:**  
Coverage constraints represent minimum required presence for a capability node.

**Permitted contribution logic:**
- Requires **primary or secondary alignment** to the capability node.
- Impact magnitude may scale with:
  - Plausibility inputs
  - Program-relative depth norms
- Multiple recruits may jointly contribute pressure toward coverage.

**Explicit limits:**
- No single recruit may be assumed to fully satisfy coverage.
- Coverage contribution does not imply lineup placement or role assignment.

---

### Article M3-CT-IV — Redundancy Contribution Rules

**Definition:**  
Redundancy constraints represent required backup depth to absorb absences or volatility.

**Permitted contribution logic:**
- Requires **primary alignment** only.
- Secondary alignment may be modeled as marginal pressure but may not be elevated.
- Redundancy impact is capped lower than coverage impact by design.

**Explicit limits:**
- Redundancy contribution may never clear a coverage absence.
- Redundancy contribution does not imply substitution readiness.

---

### Article M3-CT-V — Authority Contribution Rules

**Definition:**  
Authority constraints represent leadership, decision-making, or credentialed responsibility.

**Permitted contribution logic:**
- Requires **explicit, documented authority evidence**.
- Performance data is explicitly excluded as evidence.
- Impact magnitude is binary or tiered, not continuous.

**Explicit limits:**
- Authority may never be inferred.
- Authority contribution may not be assumed for recruits without prior verified roles.
- Authority impact may never exceed marginal contribution in M3.

---

### Article M3-CT-VI — Certification Contribution Rules

**Definition:**  
Certification constraints represent formal eligibility, compliance, or credential requirements.

**Permitted contribution logic:**
- Requires **verified certification or eligibility evidence**.
- Contribution is horizon-bound and may be null until certification is active.

**Explicit limits:**
- Certification may not be projected.
- Conditional or expected certification yields zero impact.
- Certification contribution is discrete, not graded.

---

### Article M3-CT-VII — Cross-Constraint Prohibitions

The following are explicitly forbidden:

1. Using coverage logic for redundancy
2. Treating performance as authority
3. Treating seniority as certification
4. Aggregating different constraint contributions into a single score
5. Allowing one constraint contribution to offset another

Each constraint type must remain isolated in modeling and interpretation.

---

### Article M3-CT-VIII — Impact Capping & Safeguards

- All constraint-type impacts are capped below sufficiency.
- No combination of recruits may be modeled as fully resolving a constraint.
- Constraint contribution exists only as **pressure**, not resolution.

---

### Article M3-CT-IX — Relationship to M3 Activation Gate

This canon satisfies **Precondition #2** of the M3 Activation Gate.

No M3 activation promotion may proceed without this canon being ratified.

---

### Ratification

The Recruiting M3 Constraint-Type Contribution Rules Canon is hereby ratified as authoritative.

All Recruiting M3 impact modeling must conform strictly to these constraint-specific rules.
