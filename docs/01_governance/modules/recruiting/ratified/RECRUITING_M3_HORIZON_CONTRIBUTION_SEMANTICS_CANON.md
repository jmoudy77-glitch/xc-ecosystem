# RECRUITING M3 — HORIZON CONTRIBUTION SEMANTICS CANON
## Temporal Validity & Horizon-Bound Contribution Law

---

### Article M3-HC-I — Purpose

This canon defines the **exclusive rules** governing how Recruiting M3 may model **when** a recruit’s potential contribution could plausibly apply across Program Health horizons.

Its purpose is to prevent premature, assumed, or misaligned temporal inference and to preserve the integrity of horizon-based absence semantics.

---

### Article M3-HC-II — Horizon Definitions (Authoritative)

Recruiting M3 adopts Program Health horizon definitions without modification:

- **H0:** Immediate / current season
- **H1:** Near-term (next cycle)
- **H2:** Mid-term
- **H3:** Long-term / future planning

Recruiting may not redefine, compress, or expand horizon meanings.

---

### Article M3-HC-III — Horizon Eligibility Gates

A recruit may only emit M3 impact records for horizons they are **structurally eligible** to contribute to.

Eligibility gates include:
- Enrollment timing
- Graduation year
- Explicit redshirt status
- Verified availability constraints

If eligibility is not met, **no impact record may be emitted** for that horizon.

---

### Article M3-HC-IV — Horizon-Limited Contribution Rules

1. **No forward acceleration**
   - A recruit may not contribute at an earlier horizon than structurally possible.

2. **Selective horizon omission**
   - Valid to emit impact at H2/H3 while emitting none at H0/H1.

3. **Independent horizon modeling**
   - Each horizon is modeled independently.
   - Impact at one horizon does not imply impact at another.

---

### Article M3-HC-V — Horizon Impact Modulation

Within eligible horizons, impact magnitude may be modulated by:
- Onboarding lag
- Recovery timelines (bounded, non-diagnostic)
- Known compliance or eligibility delays

Such modulation may only **reduce or defer** impact, never enhance or accelerate it.

---

### Article M3-HC-VI — Multi-Horizon Coexistence

A single recruit may:
- Emit multiple impact records across different horizons
- Belong to different cohort tiers per horizon
- Have differing impact scores per horizon

This is expected and valid behavior.

---

### Article M3-HC-VII — Prohibited Temporal Inference

The following are explicitly forbidden:

1. Assuming immediate contribution without evidence
2. Averaging impact across horizons
3. Treating future-horizon impact as present mitigation
4. Promoting long-term impact to justify short-term decisions
5. Inferring development curves to justify earlier horizons

Violation invalidates the affected impact records.

---

### Article M3-HC-VIII — Relationship to M3 Activation Gate

This canon satisfies **Precondition #3** of the M3 Activation Gate.

No M3 activation promotion may proceed without this canon being ratified.

---

### Ratification

The Recruiting M3 Horizon Contribution Semantics Canon is hereby ratified as authoritative.

All Recruiting M3 temporal modeling must conform strictly to this canon.
