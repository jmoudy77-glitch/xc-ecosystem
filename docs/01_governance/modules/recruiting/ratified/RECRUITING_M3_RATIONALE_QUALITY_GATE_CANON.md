# RECRUITING M3 — RATIONALE QUALITY GATE CANON
## Human Interpretability & Misuse Prevention Law

---

### Article M3-RQ-I — Purpose

This canon defines the **mandatory quality standards** that all Recruiting M3 rationales must satisfy before an impact record may be considered valid, persisted, or consumed.

Its purpose is to ensure:
- Human interpretability
- Absence of false certainty
- Protection against authority leakage
- Coach-safe explanatory language

---

### Article M3-RQ-II — Rationale Requirement (Non-Negotiable)

Every Recruiting Candidate Impact **must** include a rationale.

Impact records without a rationale are **constitutionally invalid** and may not be stored, surfaced, or consumed.

---

### Article M3-RQ-III — Required Rationale Components

Each rationale must explicitly reference:

1. **Structural Alignment**
   - Why the recruit aligns to the capability node
   - Whether alignment is primary or secondary

2. **Plausibility Evidence**
   - What evidence supports potential contribution
   - High-level, non-technical framing

3. **Constraint Context**
   - Which constraint type is involved
   - Why the recruit may pressure (but not resolve) it

4. **Temporal Assumptions (if applicable)**
   - Why the impact applies at this horizon
   - What prevents earlier contribution, if relevant

---

### Article M3-RQ-IV — Language Restrictions

Rationales must:

- Use **conditional language** (“could,” “may,” “is likely to pressure”)
- Avoid declarative or outcome language
- Avoid future certainty framing
- Avoid implying roster placement or role assignment

---

### Article M3-RQ-V — Explicitly Forbidden Language

The following words or implications are prohibited in rationales:

- “Fixes”
- “Solves”
- “Resolves”
- “Covers completely”
- “Guarantees”
- “Will provide”
- “Ensures”
- “Locks in”
- Any equivalent certainty phrasing

Presence of forbidden language invalidates the impact record.

---

### Article M3-RQ-VI — Coach Readability Test

Every rationale must pass the **Coach Readability Test**:

> “If shown directly to a coach, would this explanation be interpreted as advisory rather than factual resolution?”

If the answer is not unequivocally “yes,” the impact must not be emitted.

---

### Article M3-RQ-VII — Rationale Length & Clarity

- Must be concise but complete
- Must avoid internal system jargon
- Must be understandable without schema knowledge

Excess verbosity or opaque language is considered a failure.

---

### Article M3-RQ-VIII — Validation & Enforcement

- Rationale quality must be enforced via:
  - Automated validation rules, or
  - Explicit human review gates
- Invalid rationales invalidate the entire impact record
- Consumers may not attempt to “fix” or reinterpret rationales

---

### Article M3-RQ-IX — Relationship to M3 Activation Gate

This canon satisfies **Precondition #5** of the M3 Activation Gate.

No M3 activation promotion may proceed without this canon being ratified and enforced.

---

### Ratification

The Recruiting M3 Rationale Quality Gate Canon is hereby ratified as authoritative.

All Recruiting M3 impact records must conform strictly to this canon.
