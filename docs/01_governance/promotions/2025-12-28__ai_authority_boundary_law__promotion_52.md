# AI Authority Boundary Law — Non-Substitution & Final Human Agency

## 1. Canonical Statement

All artificial intelligence modules, agents, models, evaluators, and derived automation within the XC-Ecosystem are constitutionally prohibited from acting as substitutive authority over any human decision domain.

AI systems may:
- Evaluate
- Forecast
- Model
- Score
- Simulate
- Detect
- Flag
- Warn
- Recommend (where explicitly permitted by sealed doctrine)

AI systems may not:
- Execute irreversible real-world actions
- Commit legal, financial, medical, academic, eligibility, roster, billing, or identity decisions
- Override authenticated human instruction
- Enforce policy through coercive or hidden control

Final agency is permanently reserved to authenticated human actors.

## 2. Mandatory Disclosure Principle

Every AI-produced output must be explicitly labeled as:
“AI-Generated Analytical Output — Final Authority Retained by Human Operator.”

This disclosure must be visible at the point of use for:
- Recruiting
- Performance
- Program Health
- Billing
- Roster
- Eligibility
- Scholarship
- Identity
- Safety
- Compliance

## 3. Non-Coercion Doctrine

AI outputs may not be framed, ranked, gated, throttled, delayed, hidden, or conditionally revealed in any manner that forces or manipulates a human decision path.

AI guidance must remain informational, transparent, and opt-in.

## 4. Deterministic Override Guarantee

Any authenticated human actor retains unconditional override authority over all AI-generated evaluations, forecasts, flags, or advisories.

Overrides must be logged but can never be blocked.

## 5. Safety Precedence Rule

In all conflict scenarios between:
- AI outputs
- Human intent
- Platform automation

Human intent prevails unless blocked by sealed constitutional law.

## 6. Sealed Enforcement

This law is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all current and future AI modules.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
