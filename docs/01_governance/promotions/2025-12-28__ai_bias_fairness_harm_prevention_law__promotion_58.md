# AI Bias Detection, Fairness Safeguards & Harm Prevention Law

## 1. Canonical Statement

All artificial intelligence systems operating within the XC-Ecosystem must implement continuous bias detection, fairness safeguards, and harm prevention controls.

No AI system may operate if it demonstrably amplifies inequity, discrimination, or undue harm.

## 2. Mandatory Bias Surveillance

All AI pipelines must maintain continuous monitoring for:

- Disparate impact  
- Unequal error distribution  
- Systematic exclusion  
- Demographic distortion  
- Performance drift

## 3. Fairness Controls

AI systems must include safeguards preventing:

- Protected-class discrimination  
- Structural disadvantage amplification  
- Suppressive ranking or gating  
- Hidden scoring penalties  

## 4. Harm Interruption Authority

Detected harmful behavior must trigger:

- Automatic suspension of affected AI operations  
- Mandatory human review  
- Corrective remediation before reinstatement  

## 5. Disclosure Obligation

Detected bias, drift, or harm must be disclosed to impacted parties.

## 6. Sealed Enforcement

This law is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all current and future AI systems.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
