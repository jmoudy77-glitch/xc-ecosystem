# AI Consent, Scope Limitation & Purpose Binding Law

## 1. Canonical Statement

All artificial intelligence systems operating within the XC-Ecosystem are constitutionally bound to explicit consent, defined scope, and sealed purpose limitation.

No AI system may process data or generate outputs beyond its explicitly authorized purpose.

## 2. Consent Requirement

All data subjects must provide explicit, auditable consent for:

- Inclusion in AI analysis  
- Scope of AI processing  
- Purpose domain of use  

Absence of consent invalidates AI processing.

## 3. Purpose Binding

Every AI pipeline must declare a sealed purpose domain.

Outputs may not be reused, repurposed, federated, sold, or transferred outside their declared purpose domain.

## 4. Scope Boundary Enforcement

AI systems must enforce strict scope boundaries preventing:

- Cross-domain inference
- Unauthorized data reuse
- Secondary modeling
- Undisclosed enrichment

## 5. Revocation Guarantee

Data subjects retain the right to revoke AI processing consent at any time.

Revocation must immediately invalidate further AI processing.

## 6. Sealed Enforcement

This law is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all current and future AI pipelines.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
