# AI Data Lineage & Provenance Law

## 1. Canonical Statement

All artificial intelligence systems operating within the XC-Ecosystem must maintain complete, continuous, and immutable lineage and provenance records for every data element used in analytical, predictive, evaluative, or advisory processing.

No AI operation may utilize data of unknown or unverified origin.

## 2. Provenance Ledger Requirement

Each data element entering any AI pipeline must generate a provenance ledger entry containing:

- Source system or origin identifier  
- Ownership and authorization scope  
- Collection timestamp  
- Consent or governance basis  
- Transformation history  
- Storage and access classification

## 3. Lineage Chain Integrity

Lineage records must form an unbroken, auditable chain from original source through all transformations to final AI output.

Broken or missing lineage constitutes invalid data and may not be processed.

## 4. Cross-System Traceability

Data provenance and lineage must remain preserved across imports, exports, synchronization, federation, and partner integrations.

## 5. Right of Origin Disclosure

Authenticated users retain the right to inspect the provenance and lineage of any data used in AI outputs affecting their program, team, or athletes.

## 6. Sealed Enforcement

This law is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all current and future AI pipelines.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
