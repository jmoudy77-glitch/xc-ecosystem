# AI Emergency Shutdown, Incident Response & Constitutional Breach Protocol

## 1. Canonical Statement

The XC-Ecosystem must maintain a deterministic emergency shutdown and incident response authority for all artificial intelligence systems.

Any constitutional risk, harm event, or breach signal mandates immediate containment.

## 2. Emergency Shutdown Authority

The platform must retain the ability to:

- Immediately suspend any AI system  
- Revoke execution privileges  
- Freeze causal ledger mutation  
- Isolate affected data domains  

## 3. Mandatory Incident Response

Upon any suspected constitutional breach:

- Affected AI modules must be immediately suspended  
- Human constitutional review is mandatory  
- Impact scope must be logged and disclosed  
- Remediation must be completed before reinstatement  

## 4. Breach Classification

Incidents must be classified by:

- Severity  
- Impacted domains  
- Data exposure risk  
- Harm surface  

## 5. Non-Bypassability

No automation, user role, or subsystem may bypass emergency shutdown authority.

## 6. Sealed Enforcement

This protocol is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all current and future AI systems.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
