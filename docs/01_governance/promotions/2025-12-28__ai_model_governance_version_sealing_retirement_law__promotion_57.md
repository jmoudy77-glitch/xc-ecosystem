# AI Model Governance, Version Sealing & Retirement Law

## 1. Canonical Statement

All artificial intelligence models operating within the XC-Ecosystem must be governed by sealed versioning, deterministic change control, and formal retirement procedures.

No model may operate without an immutable version identity.

## 2. Version Sealing

Each AI model must declare:

- Immutable version identifier  
- Training dataset lineage references  
- Capability scope  
- Safety tier classification  
- Deployment authorization record  

Version identities may not be altered after activation.

## 3. Change Control

Any modification to model weights, logic, prompts, data scope, or decision influence constitutes a new sealed version and requires reclassification and reauthorization.

## 4. Retirement Protocol

Retired models must:

- Be permanently deactivated  
- Retain causal ledger accessibility  
- Remain auditable for historical outputs  
- Never be reactivated  

## 5. Mandatory Sunset Review

All active AI models must undergo periodic constitutional review for continued authorization.

## 6. Sealed Enforcement

This law is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all current and future AI models.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
