# AI Risk Classification & Safety Tier Law

## 1. Canonical Statement

All artificial intelligence systems operating within the XC-Ecosystem must be classified into deterministic safety tiers based on potential real-world impact, reversibility, and harm surface.

No AI module may operate without an assigned safety tier.

## 2. Safety Tier Classes

AI systems are constitutionally classified as:

**Tier 0 — Informational**
- Descriptive analytics
- Static reporting
- Historical summaries

**Tier 1 — Advisory**
- Forecasting
- Scoring
- Recommendations
- Simulations

**Tier 2 — Operational Support**
- Automated workflows
- Event sequencing
- Non-binding system actions

**Tier 3 — Restricted**
- Any AI with potential financial, eligibility, identity, safety, or compliance impact

Tier 3 systems require explicit constitutional approval to exist.

## 3. Tier Governance Requirements

Each tier mandates:

- Explicit tier labeling
- Elevated disclosure surfaces
- Tier-appropriate logging depth
- Tier-appropriate human oversight thresholds

## 4. Unauthorized Tier Escalation

Any AI module operating above its assigned tier constitutes a constitutional breach.

## 5. Mandatory Reclassification

All AI modules must be reclassified upon material change to capability, scope, or data authority.

## 6. Sealed Enforcement

This law is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all current and future AI systems.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
