# Billing Determinism, Price Authority & Charge Integrity Law

## 1. Canonical Statement

All billing, subscription, pricing, fee, discount, credit, scholarship application, and monetary charge logic within the XC-Ecosystem must operate deterministically under sealed price authority.

No monetary charge may occur without canonical authorization.

## 2. Price Authority

All price definitions, plans, tiers, and fee schedules must be sealed, versioned, and constitutionally authorized.

## 3. Deterministic Charge Construction

Every charge must produce an immutable ledger record including:

- Authorized price identifier  
- Calculation path  
- Applied modifiers  
- Actor or system initiator  
- Timestamp  

## 4. Non-Bypassability

No automation, API, or integration may bypass canonical billing logic.

## 5. Refund & Reversal Governance

All reversals, refunds, credits, and adjustments must be fully auditable and governed by sealed refund canon.

## 6. Sealed Enforcement

This law is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all billing and economic modules.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
