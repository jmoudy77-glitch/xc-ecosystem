# Promotion 19 — Roster Builder Canonical Boundary Lock

This promotion permanently seals the authority boundaries and prohibited behaviors of the Roster Builder module.

## 1) Canonical role

Roster Builder is constructive-only.

Roster Builder owns:
- roster slot allocation
- athlete assignment
- eligibility mapping
- structure composition

Roster Builder must consume Recruiting outputs as canonical fact.

## 2) Prohibited behaviors

Roster Builder may not:
- reinterpret A1 or Recruiting analytics
- generate recruiting logic or probabilities
- issue performance diagnostics
- embed philosophy alignment logic as gating or decision drivers
- back-propagate corrections upstream

## 3) Downstream guarantees

Roster Builder must expose stable, deterministic outputs for:
- performance diagnostics
- philosophy audit correlation

## 4) Finalization

No future feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
