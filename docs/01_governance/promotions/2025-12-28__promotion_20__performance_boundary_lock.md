# Promotion 20 — Performance Canonical Boundary Lock

This promotion permanently seals the authority boundaries and prohibited behaviors of the Performance module.

## 1) Canonical role

Performance is observational and diagnostic-only.

Performance owns:
- performance measurement
- compliance evaluation
- trend detection
- risk surfacing

Performance must consume Roster Builder outputs as canonical fact.

## 2) Prohibited behaviors

Performance may not:
- issue recruiting logic or probabilities
- generate roster construction logic
- reinterpret A1 or Recruiting analytics
- embed philosophy alignment logic as gating or decision drivers
- back-propagate corrections upstream

## 3) Downstream guarantees

Performance must expose stable, deterministic outputs for:
- philosophy audit correlation

## 4) Finalization

No future feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
