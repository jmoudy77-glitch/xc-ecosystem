# Promotion 23 — A1 Horizon Scope Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals horizon scoping as a canonical structural property of the A1 Absence Engine.

## 1) Canonical horizon model

A1 outputs must be evaluated and recorded across the following horizons:

| Horizon | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| H0 | Immediate operational absence risk |
| H1 | Short-range season viability |
| H2 | Mid-range program continuity |
| H3 | Long-range program survivability |

## 2) Structural guarantees

All A1 absence records must include:
- horizon classification
- deterministic absence state
- timestamped causal snapshot

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

No downstream module may:
- collapse horizon distinctions
- merge horizons into single risk states
- reinterpret horizon scopes

## 4) Finalization

No future module, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
