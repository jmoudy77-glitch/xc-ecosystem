# Promotion 25 — Recruiting Offer Structure Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals the structural requirements for recruiting offer construction.

## 1) Canonical offer components

All recruiting offers must be composed from:
- absence-mitigated targeting logic derived from A1
- commitment probability modeling
- roster slot availability
- scholarship and aid input structures

## 2) Structural guarantees

Offers must be:
- deterministic
- attributable to causal inputs
- auditable across Program Health, Recruiting, and Roster Builder layers

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

Offers may not:
- be issued without A1-derived absence mitigation context
- embed performance diagnostics as offer drivers
- embed philosophy alignment logic as gating conditions

## 4) Finalization

No future recruiting feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
