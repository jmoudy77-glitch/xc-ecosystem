# Promotion 28 — Performance Diagnostic Output Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals diagnostic output structuring as a canonical function of the Performance module.

## 1) Canonical diagnostic outputs

Performance diagnostics must be structured into:
- compliance indicators
- trend vectors
- risk flags

## 2) Structural guarantees

All diagnostic outputs must be:
- attributable to roster-based causal inputs
- deterministic and auditable

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

Diagnostics may not:
- embed recruiting logic
- embed roster construction logic
- embed philosophy alignment gating
- issue recommendations

## 4) Finalization

No future performance feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
