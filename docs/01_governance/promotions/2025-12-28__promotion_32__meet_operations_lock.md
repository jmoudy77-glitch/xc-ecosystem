# Promotion 32 — Meet Operations Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals meet operations as a canonical execution-layer function.

## 1) Canonical meet operations role

Meet operations owns:
- meet instantiation
- event scheduling
- athlete event assignment
- result capture
- official compliance logging

## 2) Structural guarantees

All meet operation records must be:
- attributable to coach action logs
- timestamped and immutable
- auditable against roster, performance, and compliance layers

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

Meet operations may not:
- embed recruiting logic
- embed performance diagnostics as causal drivers
- issue recommendations

## 4) Finalization

No future meet feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
