# Promotion 34 — Notification Execution Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals notification execution as a canonical execution-layer function.

## 1) Canonical notification role

Notification execution owns:
- system-generated alerts
- compliance notices
- scheduling confirmations
- coach and athlete communications

## 2) Structural guarantees

All notification records must be:
- attributable to causal execution events
- timestamped and immutable
- auditable

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

Notifications may not:
- embed recruiting logic
- embed performance diagnostics as causal drivers
- issue recommendations

## 4) Finalization

No future notification feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
