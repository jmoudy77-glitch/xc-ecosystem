# Promotion 37 — Athlete Identity Canonical Root Lock

This promotion permanently seals athlete identity as a canonical root data authority.

## 1) Canonical identity role

Each athlete must have exactly one canonical identity root.

The canonical identity root owns:
- legal identity references
- eligibility anchors
- historical record continuity

## 2) Structural guarantees

All athlete-linked records must reference a canonical identity root.

Identity roots must be immutable once established.

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

No module may:
- create parallel canonical identities
- rewrite canonical identity roots
- orphan historical records

## 4) Finalization

No future feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
