# Promotion 39 — Athlete Data Authority Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals athlete data authority boundaries.

## 1) Canonical data authority

Athlete data authority owns:
- demographic records
- academic records
- athletic performance records
- eligibility and compliance records

All athlete data must reference canonical athlete identity roots.

## 2) Structural guarantees

All athlete data must be:
- immutable
- auditable
- attributable to a causal source

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

No module may:
- generate unverifiable athlete data
- rewrite canonical athlete records
- create parallel athlete histories

## 4) Finalization

No future feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
