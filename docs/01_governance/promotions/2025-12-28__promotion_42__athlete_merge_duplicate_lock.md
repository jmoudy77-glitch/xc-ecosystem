# Promotion 42 — Athlete Merge & Duplicate Resolution Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals duplicate detection and merge resolution as canonical athlete identity governance functions.

## 1) Canonical merge role

Duplicate detection and merge resolution owns:
- duplicate identity detection
- merge arbitration
- lineage preservation
- canonical root reassignment

## 2) Structural guarantees

All merges must:
- preserve historical lineage
- be auditable
- be append-only
- maintain a single canonical identity root

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

No module may:
- delete athlete histories
- collapse or rewrite canonical identity roots
- perform unlogged merges

## 4) Finalization

No future identity feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
