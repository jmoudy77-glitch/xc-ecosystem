# Promotion 44 — Athlete Identity & Records Canonical Closure Lock

This promotion permanently seals athlete identity and record systems as a closed, governed canonical domain.

## 1) Canonical identity domain

Athlete identity and record systems include:
- canonical identity roots
- immutable athlete records
- record lineage and media evidence
- merge and duplicate resolution
- external ingestion governance

## 2) Structural guarantees

Athlete identity systems must:
- preserve canonical roots
- remain fully auditable
- maintain immutable lineage continuity

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

Athlete identity systems may not:
- back-propagate corrections upstream
- embed recruiting or analytical logic
- issue recommendations

## 4) Finalization

No future identity feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
