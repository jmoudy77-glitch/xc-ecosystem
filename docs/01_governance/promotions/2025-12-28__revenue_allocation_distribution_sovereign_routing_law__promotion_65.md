# Revenue Allocation, Distribution & Sovereign Routing Law

## 1. Canonical Statement

All revenue allocation, distribution, revenue sharing, commission routing, and internal financial flows within the XC-Ecosystem must be governed as sovereign routing operations.

No revenue movement may occur without canonical routing authorization.

## 2. Sovereign Routing Authority

All revenue paths must be:

- Predefined  
- Sealed  
- Auditable  
- Causally bound  

## 3. Allocation Ledger Requirement

Every revenue distribution must generate immutable allocation ledger entries including:

- Source revenue event  
- Destination entity  
- Allocation rule reference  
- Amount  
- Timestamp  

## 4. Non-Bypassability

No automation or integration may bypass sovereign routing logic.

## 5. Sealed Enforcement

This law is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all revenue routing and allocation systems.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
