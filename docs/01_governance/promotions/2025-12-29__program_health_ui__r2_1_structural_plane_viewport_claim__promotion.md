# Program Health UI — R2.1 Structural Plane Viewport Claim Promotion

Purpose
- Make the structural plane claim viewport height and reduce dead space.

Files Changed
- app/ui/program-health/ProgramHealthPage.tsx

Acceptance Checks
- The plane area fills most of the viewport height.
- The big empty dead space below is gone or dramatically reduced.
- The disc scales up because the plane has real height.
