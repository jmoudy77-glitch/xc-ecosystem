# Program Health UI — MB-1 Material Baseline (Graphite Ice Saucer)
Date: 2025-12-31
Project: xc-ecosystem
Module: Program Health UI

## Baseline Intent
Freeze the disc’s material embodiment as of post-R3.6:
a physical graphite-ice saucer with NOW-weighted thickness,
temporal rim falloff, grounding shadow, and icy rim lift realism.

This document is the **perceptual anchor** for all future experiential tuning.

## Frozen Properties

### Disc Body
• Saucer geometry (smooth icy saucer)
• Visible side wall thickness
• NOW-weighted core thickening
• Grounding radial shadow

### Rim
• Temporal rim falloff
• Pale icy lift highlight band

### Surface
• Dark graphite ice tone
• Matte low-specular surface

### Interaction
• R3.4 drag-to-spin behavior preserved
• All body layers non-interactive

### Scope Lock
All future changes to:
• Rim shading
• Shadow weight
• Vein visibility
• Melt geometry
must be authored as **MB-1.x amendments**.
