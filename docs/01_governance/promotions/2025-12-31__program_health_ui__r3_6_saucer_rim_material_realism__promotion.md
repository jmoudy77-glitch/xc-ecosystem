# Program Health UI — R3.6 Saucer Rim Material Realism (Icy Lift Band)
Date: 2025-12-31
Project: xc-ecosystem
Module: Program Health UI

## Intent
Introduce a subtle pale rim “lift highlight” just inside the disc edge to make the saucer read as frozen graphite-ice rather than shaded UI.

## Changes
- Update ph-disc-saucer gradient to include a faint light band inside the rim.
- No geometry, interaction, or data changes.
