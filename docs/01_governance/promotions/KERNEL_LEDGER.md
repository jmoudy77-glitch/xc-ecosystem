- **Promotion ID:** K-001
- **Date (America/Chicago):** 2026-01-09
- **Type:** Canon (Kernel)
- **Canonical Surfaces Modified:**
  - Kernel Constitution Thread (ratified as supreme operational law)
  - `/docs` canon plane governance: establishes `/docs` supremacy and ledger authority
- **Summary:**
  - Ratifies the XC-ECOSYSTEM KERNEL CONSTITUTION (First Edition) as effective immediately upon publication in the Kernel Constitution Thread, governing all XC-Ecosystem development henceforth.
- **Locked Contracts Impacted:**
  - Establishes the Kernel Constitution as a locked, ratified contract for governance.
- **Notes:**
  - This entry is the genesis record for Kernel governance under `/docs` canon supremacy.

## K-0001 — Cross-Runtime Alignment: Program Health ↔ Performance Balance Semantics

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Status:** Ratified  
**Scope:** Kernel  
**Type:** Cross-Runtime Alignment Canon  

### Artifact Ratified
/docs/01_governance/kernel/ratified/KERNEL_PROGRAM_HEALTH_PERFORMANCE_ALIGNMENT.md

### Summary
Establishes kernel-level semantic alignment between Program Health and Performance runtimes for balance, equilibrium, direction, volatility, and glyph architecture, while preserving runtime sovereignty over data.

### Canonical Effects
- Declares balance primitives as kernel-shared
- Locks equilibrium and directional semantics across runtimes
- Mandates glyph architectural reuse with data isolation
- Classifies cross-runtime semantic drift as a first-class defect

### Governance
Any modification requires a Kernel-level promotion.
