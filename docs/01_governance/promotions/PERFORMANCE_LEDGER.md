## P-0001 — Performance Balance Instrument: Layered Interaction & Permission Canon

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Status:** Ratified  
**Scope:** Performance Runtime  
**Type:** Canonical Governance Artifact  

### Artifact Ratified
/docs/01_governance/modules/performance/ratified/PERFORMANCE_BALANCE_INSTRUMENT_LAYERS.md

### Summary
Ratifies the three-layer interaction and permission model governing the Performance Balance Instrument:
1. Volumetric Context Layer (3D, read-only)
2. Projected Analysis Layer (2D, controlled interaction)
3. Summary Glyph Layer (derived, reactionary)

### Canonical Effects
- Locks 3D balance model as observational-only
- Declares projections as sole analytical interaction surfaces
- Binds balance glyph strictly downstream of the model
- Supersedes all prior informal balance-field interaction assumptions

### Cross-Runtime Impact
None.

### Governance
Modifications require a formal Performance Runtime promotion.

## P-0002 — Performance Balance Instrument: Projection Interaction Law

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Status:** Ratified  
**Scope:** Performance Runtime  
**Type:** Canonical Interaction Law  

### Artifact Ratified
/docs/01_governance/modules/performance/ratified/PERFORMANCE_BALANCE_PROJECTION_INTERACTION_LAW.md

### Summary
Establishes the authoritative interaction rules for the Performance Balance Instrument, defining snap thresholds, projection states, interaction permissions, and mutual exclusivity between time and dichotomy navigation.

### Canonical Effects
- Locks interaction authority to projection states only
- Formalizes snap thresholds and restoration behavior
- Prevents mixed-mode interaction ambiguity
- Supersedes all informal projection behaviors

### Cross-Runtime Impact
None.

### Governance
Modifications require a formal Performance Runtime promotion.

## P-0003 — Performance Balance Instrument: Derivation Law (Model → Summary Glyph)

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Status:** Ratified  
**Scope:** Performance Runtime  
**Type:** Canonical Derivation Law  

### Artifact Ratified
/docs/01_governance/modules/performance/ratified/PERFORMANCE_BALANCE_DERIVATION_LAW.md

### Summary
Ratifies the lawful derivation rules binding the Performance Summary Glyph to the Performance Balance Instrument, including canonical inputs, per-dichotomy components, five-tier quantization, global aggregation, rendering constraints, and drift prevention.

### Canonical Effects
- Locks the Summary Glyph as strictly downstream of the instrument at t0
- Prevents adaptive or relative thresholds in the glyph
- Establishes fixed quantization tiers and net-bias aggregation
- Defines volatility as optional, categorical, and non-historical in display
- Establishes derivation drift as a promotable defect class

### Cross-Runtime Impact
None.

### Governance
Modifications require a formal Performance Runtime promotion.

## P-0004 — Performance Balance Instrument: Instrumentation Implementation Specification

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Status:** Ratified  
**Scope:** Performance Runtime  
**Type:** Canonical Implementation Specification  

### Artifact Ratified
/docs/01_governance/modules/performance/ratified/PERFORMANCE_BALANCE_INSTRUMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md

### Summary
Ratifies the concrete implementation requirements for the Performance Balance Instrument, including rendering architecture, data flow contracts, performance constraints, interaction enforcement, glyph implementation, and drift validation.

### Canonical Effects
- Binds all implementations to deterministic, read-only volumetric rendering
- Enforces single-source data flow across volumetric, projection, and glyph layers
- Locks performance and transition budgets
- Establishes validation hooks for drift detection
- Defines lawful degradation and accessibility behavior

### Cross-Runtime Impact
None.

### Governance
Modifications require a formal Performance Runtime promotion.
