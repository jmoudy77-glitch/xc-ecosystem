## P-0001 — Performance Balance Instrument: Layered Interaction & Permission Canon

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Status:** Ratified  
**Scope:** Performance Runtime  
**Type:** Canonical Governance Artifact  

### Artifact Ratified
/docs/01_governance/modules/performance/ratified/PERFORMANCE_BALANCE_INSTRUMENT_LAYERS.md

### Summary
Ratifies the three-layer interaction and permission model governing the Performance Balance Instrument:
1. Volumetric Context Layer (3D, read-only)
2. Projected Analysis Layer (2D, controlled interaction)
3. Summary Glyph Layer (derived, reactionary)

### Canonical Effects
- Locks 3D balance model as observational-only
- Declares projections as sole analytical interaction surfaces
- Binds balance glyph strictly downstream of the model
- Supersedes all prior informal balance-field interaction assumptions

### Cross-Runtime Impact
None.

### Governance
Modifications require a formal Performance Runtime promotion.

## P-0002 — Performance Balance Instrument: Projection Interaction Law

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Status:** Ratified  
**Scope:** Performance Runtime  
**Type:** Canonical Interaction Law  

### Artifact Ratified
/docs/01_governance/modules/performance/ratified/PERFORMANCE_BALANCE_PROJECTION_INTERACTION_LAW.md

### Summary
Establishes the authoritative interaction rules for the Performance Balance Instrument, defining snap thresholds, projection states, interaction permissions, and mutual exclusivity between time and dichotomy navigation.

### Canonical Effects
- Locks interaction authority to projection states only
- Formalizes snap thresholds and restoration behavior
- Prevents mixed-mode interaction ambiguity
- Supersedes all informal projection behaviors

### Cross-Runtime Impact
None.

### Governance
Modifications require a formal Performance Runtime promotion.
