# R-M3-0011 — Activate Recruiting M3 Runtime
## Explicit Runtime Activation Promotion

---

### Promotion Type
Explicit Runtime Activation (Recruiting M3)

---

### Purpose

This promotion formally **activates the Recruiting M3 runtime**, authorizing computation, persistence, and controlled downstream consumption of Recruiting Candidate Impact records in strict compliance with all previously ratified M3 canons.

This promotion is the **only lawful mechanism** by which M3 may transition from constitutionally dormant to operationally active.

---

### Preconditions (All Required)

The following ratified canons are mandatory prerequisites and are hereby acknowledged as satisfied:

1. Recruiting M3 Canon Surface  
2. Recruiting M3 Input Canon  
3. Recruiting M3 Output Semantics  
4. Recruiting M3 Activation Gate Canon  
5. Recruiting M3 Capability Node Mapping Canon  
6. Recruiting M3 Constraint-Type Contribution Rules Canon  
7. Recruiting M3 Horizon Contribution Semantics Canon  
8. Recruiting M3 Negative & Null Impact Emission Canon  
9. Recruiting M3 Rationale Quality Gate Canon  
10. Recruiting M3 Program Health Isolation Test Canon  

Failure of any prerequisite invalidates this promotion.

---

### Activation Authorization

Upon application of this promotion, the following are explicitly authorized:

1. **M3 Computation**
   - Execution of Recruiting M3 impact modeling logic
   - Generation of Recruiting Candidate Impact records

2. **M3 Persistence**
   - Writing to `recruiting_candidate_impacts`
   - Storage of rationale and inputs_hash per canon

3. **Controlled Consumption**
   - Recruiting-side advisory UI consumption
   - Conditional overlays explicitly labeled hypothetical
   - Program Health read-only contextual access (non-authoritative)

---

### Explicit Prohibitions (Remain in Force)

Even after activation, M3 may **never**:

- Mutate Program Health canonical state
- Clear, downgrade, or suppress A2 absences
- Trigger Program Health recomputation
- Represent modeled impact as factual resolution
- Drive automation without human confirmation

All previously ratified prohibitions remain binding.

---

### Verification Requirements (Binding)

Before this promotion may be applied in any environment, the following must be verifiably true:

1. Program Health isolation tests pass
2. Rationale validation gates are enforced
3. Negative & null impact emission logic is implemented
4. Horizon eligibility gating is enforced
5. Constraint-type contribution rules are encoded
6. Audit logging for M3 execution is active

Application without verification constitutes a constitutional violation.

---

### Rollback Clause

If any post-activation violation is detected:

- M3 computation must be immediately disabled
- Impact records must be quarantined
- A rollback promotion must be applied
- An incident entry must be recorded in the Recruiting Ledger

---

### Activation Statement

By ratifying and applying this promotion, Recruiting M3 is formally declared **operational**.

All M3 behavior from this point forward is subject to:
- Canon enforcement
- Auditability
- Cross-runtime sovereignty guarantees

---

### Status

**Not Applied**  
(Draft — pending explicit approval and execution)
