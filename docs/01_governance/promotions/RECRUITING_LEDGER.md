## R-0001 — Recruiting Runtime Constitution (First Edition)

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Type:** Constitutional Ratification  
**Scope:** Recruiting Runtime (Sovereign)  
**Upstream Dependencies:** XC-Ecosystem Kernel Constitution  
**Downstream Impact:** All Recruiting schema, logic, UI, and promotions

---

### Summary

This promotion ratifies the **Recruiting Runtime Constitution — First Edition**, formally establishing Recruiting as a sovereign runtime within the XC-Ecosystem and locking its canonical laws, boundaries, and invariants.

This entry does **not** introduce functional changes. It establishes binding law governing all future Recruiting development.

---

### Ratified Artifacts

- Recruiting Runtime Constitution (First Edition)
- Canon surfaces defined under:
  - `/docs/01_governance/modules/recruiting/ratified/*`
  - `/docs/03_domain_models/recruiting/*`
  - `/docs/04_operational_modules/recruiting/*`

---

### Constitutional Effects

- Declares Recruiting a **sovereign runtime**
- Locks **slot-centric design** as the canonical recruiting model
- Establishes **module boundary law** (`lib/modules/recruiting` as sole domain plane)
- Enforces **canonical event emission** and causal chain integrity
- Formalizes **promotion + ledger discipline** via the Triple-Lock Rule
- Locks **Recruiting Primary Surface UI invariants**
- Codifies **drift prevention law**

---

### Explicit Invariants Introduced

- Recruiting operates **only on recruitable deficits**
- Non-recruitable deficits are **constitutionally invisible**
- Recruiting is **coach-owned and non-terminal**
- AI posture is **advisory and comparative only**
- **Slots may be unoccupied, partially stabilized, or provisionally stabilized, but never bypassed**

### Migration

None  
(Constitutional ratification only)

### Schema Changes

### Notes

This ledger entry serves as the **root authority** for all subsequent Recruiting promotions.  
Any Recruiting change that violates this constitution is invalid, regardless of implementation correctness.

**Status:** Ratified  
**Authority:** Recruiting Runtime Constitution  
**Effective:** Immediately upon publication


## R-0002 — Pre-Constitution Recruiting Promotions Backfill

**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Type:** Canon Backfill / Historical Ratification  
**Scope:** Recruiting Runtime  
**Upstream Dependencies:**  
- R-0001 — Recruiting Runtime Constitution (First Edition)

**Downstream Impact:** Recruiting canon history normalization

---

### Summary

This promotion backfills and formally ratifies all **Recruiting promotions implemented prior to the adoption of the Recruiting Runtime Constitution (First Edition)**.

These promotions were developed **before constitutional law was published**, but are hereby declared **canon-aligned** and valid under the now-ratified Recruiting constitutional framework.

No functional, schema, or behavioral changes are introduced by this promotion.

---

### Promotions Ratified by Reference

The following Recruiting developments are acknowledged as constitutionally compliant:

#### Stabilization (M1)
- Recruiting M1 read-only stabilization surface
- Recruitable-only deficit filtering
- Band-based stabilization status (non-terminal)
- Recruiting state signals (non-authoritative)
- No-leak enforcement for non-recruitable deficits

#### Slot-Centric Recruiting Surface
- Slot-based primary recruiting board
- Slot container UI invariants
- Athlete card interaction constraints
- Presence meter placement
- Single-row default expansion behavior

#### Discovery, Surfaced, and Favorites Pipelines
- Discovery portal as subordinate to slots
- Favorites and surfaced lists as pre-slot filters
- No bypass of slot occupancy
- Coach-confirmed actions only (no silent automation)

#### Canonical Event & Ledger Infrastructure
- Recruiting canonical event emission
- Upstream Program Health A1 causal attachment
- Recruiting ledger and candidate impact recording
- AI causal ledger usage for interpretability

---

### Constitutional Alignment Declaration

All referenced promotions are declared compliant with:

- Slot-Centric Law
- Boundary Discipline (Program Health → Recruiting)
- Canonical Event Law
- AI Advisory Posture
- Coach Ownership / Non-Terminal Doctrine
- Drift Prevention Law
- UI Invariants

Any behavior or artifact not explicitly listed above remains subject to future ratification or correction.

---

### Migration

None  
(Historical ratification only)

---

### Schema Changes

None

---

### Notes

This entry establishes a **clean constitutional baseline** for the Recruiting Runtime.

All future Recruiting promotions must:
- Reference this ledger
- Comply fully with R-0001
- Follow the Triple-Lock Rule

**Status:** Ratified  
**Authority:** Recruiting Runtime Constitution
