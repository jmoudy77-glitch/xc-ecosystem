# Navigation and Information Architecture
**Authority Level:** UI System Law (binding)  
**Purpose:** Define how coaches move through the system and how information is organized.

---

## 1. IA Thesis
Navigation should mirror the coach’s operating rhythm:
- program posture (Program Health)
- pipeline building (Recruiting)
- roster composition (Roster & Scholarships)
- season execution (Performance / Practice Scheduler)
- competition operations (Meet Management)

The IA exists to reduce “where is that?” friction and preserve orientation.

---

## 2. Primary Navigation (Program Shell)
Primary nav should reflect canonical modules:
- Program Health
- Recruiting
- Roster & Scholarships
- Performance
- Meets
- Team / Staff (where applicable)
- Settings (permissions, billing, branding)

Rule: Primary nav does not sprawl. Secondary pages live inside modules.

---

## 3. Context Anchors
The UI must make these scopes visible:
- Program (always)
- Team (if applicable)
- Season (frequently)
- Sport (XC vs T&F where relevant)

If a coach can make a decision without knowing the scope, the UI is failing.

---

## 4. Module Landing Pages
Each module has a “home” that provides:
- executive summary (what matters now)
- top 3 next actions
- “what changed since last time”
- drill-down pathways

These are not dashboards for dashboards’ sake; they are decision surfaces.

---

## 5. Cross-Module Links (Allowed, Governed)
Cross-module navigation is allowed only when:
- it preserves ownership (no editing foreign truth)
- it carries context (breadcrumbs, back-links)
- it is intentional (e.g., from Recruit → Roster scenario; from Meet result → Performance analysis)

Rule: Cross-links must never create duplicate “edit” surfaces for the same authoritative entity.

---

## 6. Search and “Jump To”
Provide a global “jump to” that can locate:
- athletes
- recruits
- meets
- practices
- notes and decision records

Search results must clearly indicate:
- which module owns the entity
- what scope the entity is in (season/team)

---

## 7. Definition of Done (IA)
IA is compliant if:
- primary nav reflects modules
- scopes are visible and stable
- each module has a clear landing page
- cross-module links do not violate ownership
