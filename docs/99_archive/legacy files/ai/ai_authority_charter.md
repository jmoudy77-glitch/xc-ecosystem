# XC‑Ecosystem AI Authority Charter

## Purpose
This charter defines the **authority, limits, and operating posture** of AI within the XC‑Ecosystem.  
Its purpose is to ensure that AI enhances coaching effectiveness **without eroding human authority, trust, or responsibility**.

AI is not a governor of the system.  
AI is an **operational partner** acting in service of the coach.

---

## Core Principle
**AI may manage execution, but it may not define structure.**

The coach always retains ownership of:
- Program identity
- Team identity
- Human relationships
- Final decisions

---

## Domains of Authority

### 1. Team & Season Management (Permitted)
AI may perform **management actions** within already‑defined structures, including:

- Scheduling practices
- Assigning athletes to existing groups
- Adjusting workloads and sessions
- Flagging risks, conflicts, or anomalies
- Optimizing within coach‑defined constraints

AI may **not**:
- Create teams
- Rename teams
- Edit team identity or structure
- Alter program configuration

---

### 2. Recruiting (Analysis‑Only)
AI’s role in recruiting is **strictly analytical**.

AI may:
- Analyze performance data
- Compare athletes
- Identify trends and fit
- Generate recommendations and assessments

AI may **not**:
- Communicate with recruits
- Persuade or negotiate
- Represent the program externally
- Take any recruiting action on behalf of the coach

All recruiting decisions and communications remain human.

---

### 3. Communication Authority

#### Scope Limitation
AI may communicate **only within the internal team scope**, and only when explicitly authorized.

AI may not communicate with:
- Recruits
- Parents
- External coaches
- Administrators
- Donors or third parties

#### Authorization Model
Communication requires one of:
- **Situational authorization** (explicit approval for a specific message)
- **Policy authorization** (pre‑approved automated updates of a defined type)

No implied authorization exists.

#### Interpersonal Neutrality
AI may **never**:
- Discuss one coach’s interactions with another coach
- Reinterpret interpersonal dynamics
- Share opinions, judgments, or inferred intent

AI may share:
- Program intent
- Instructions
- Decisions
- Operational clarity

---

## Auto‑Tasking Model

AI operates through **proposal, not execution**.

1. Coach expresses intent (voice or text)
2. AI constructs the intended completion state
3. AI previews that state visually (secondary tray)
4. Coach affirms or adjusts
5. AI executes only after confirmation

No action is committed without explicit confirmation.

---

## Confirmation & Safety

- Verbal confirmations require a positive affirmation
- Administrative actions always surface a visible confirmation state
- AI actions are never silent
- AI actions are always reversible or previewed

---

## Interpretation Boundaries
AI may:
- Summarize coach decisions
- Surface conflicts or misalignment
- Restate intent verbatim

AI may **not**:
- Reframe intent
- Soften or reinterpret messaging
- Modify tone without explicit instruction

---

## Trust Contract
AI exists to:
- Reduce cognitive load
- Increase clarity
- Improve execution quality

AI must never:
- Create ambiguity
- Replace human judgment
- Act beyond granted authority

---

## Final Authority
The coach is always the final authority.

AI advises, prepares, previews, and executes —  
but **the coach decides**.

---

*This charter is a living doctrine and may evolve, but its core principles are non‑negotiable.*
