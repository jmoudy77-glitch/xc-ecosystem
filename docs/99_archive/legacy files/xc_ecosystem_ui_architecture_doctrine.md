# XC-Ecosystem UI Architecture Doctrine

*Foundational UI Governance Document*

This document defines the **foundational UI architecture doctrine** for the XC‑Ecosystem.  
It translates the ecosystem’s constitutional principles into **clear guidance for navigation, workflow separation, and cognitive load management**.

This doctrine governs *how the system is structured*, not how it is implemented.

---

## Core Premise

> **Top-level navigation represents what coaches want to do.  
Administrative obligations exist in a separate context and surface only as calm, contextual signals when necessary.**

This separation is intentional.  
It is designed to reduce anxiety, preserve motivation, and increase long-term engagement.

---

## Cognitive Domains

The XC‑Ecosystem recognizes two distinct coaching mental modes:

### 1. Athletic Domain
*Generative, creative, performance-focused*

- Training
- Competition
- Athlete development
- Recruiting strategy
- Performance analysis

This domain:
- Owns the default experience
- Encourages flow and iteration
- Tolerates experimentation and recovery

---

### 2. Administrative Domain
*Preservative, defensive, consequence-aware*

- Roster state
- Scholarships and budgeting
- Compliance
- Staff governance
- Records and reporting
- Program configuration

This domain:
- Is entered deliberately
- Is visually restrained
- Prioritizes clarity, finality, and minimal interaction

---

## Top-Level Navigation Doctrine

### Governing Rule

> **If a function reflects what a coach wants to do, it may live at the top level.  
If a function reflects what a coach must do, it must not.**

Top-level items must represent **primary mental workspaces**, not organizational structures or system boundaries.

---

## Athletic Domain — Top-Level Workspaces

These areas define the coach’s daily experience:

- **Dashboard** – Orientation and awareness (athletic-first)
- **Athletes** – Longitudinal understanding of people and development
- **Training** – Practice planning and execution
- **Meets / Competition** – Preparation, performance, and analysis
- **Recruiting** – Talent evaluation and strategic pipeline building

These spaces should feel:
- Energizing
- Predictable
- Safe for exploration

---

## Administrative Domain — Separate Context

Administrative areas must **never compete for attention** with athletic work.

Includes:
- Roster Management
- Scholarships & Budgeting
- Compliance
- Staff & Roles
- Communication Records
- Reports & Exports
- Program Settings
- Account Management

Administrative work must be:
- Minimal-touch
- Obvious
- Fast
- Final

No cleverness. No discovery.

---

## Cross-Domain Interaction Rules

Some information may appear across domains with different affordances.

### Ownership Rule
- **If an action changes institutional state → Administrative owns it**
- **If information informs coaching decisions → Athletic may display it (read-only)**

Athletic workflows may *reference* administrative state.  
Administrative workflows may *not intrude* into athletic flow.

---

## Dashboard Doctrine

The dashboard is a **mediator**, not an enforcer.

- Administrative items appear as **status signals**, not task lists
- Alerts are calm, contextual, and proportionate
- No persistent anxiety-inducing indicators

The dashboard informs.  
It does not interrupt.

---

## Visibility & Anxiety Management

The system intentionally limits administrative visibility to:

- Prevent background dread
- Reduce avoidance behavior
- Preserve goodwill toward the platform

Accountability is enforced through:
- Clear state
- Proper timing
- Explicit consequence framing

Not through pressure or noise.

---

## Design Outcomes This Doctrine Protects

- Reduced cognitive load
- Increased athletic engagement
- Higher administrative completion rates
- Clear UI placement decisions
- Long-term trust in the ecosystem

---

## Closing Statement

This doctrine exists to ensure that **clarity, motivation, and trust scale alongside capability**.

The XC‑Ecosystem is not merely powerful —  
it is **respectful of the human attention it depends on**.

---

*This document serves as permanent UI governance guidance for the XC‑Ecosystem.*
