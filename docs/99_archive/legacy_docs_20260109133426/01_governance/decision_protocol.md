# Decision Protocol
**Authority Level:** Governance (binding)  
**Purpose:** Standardize how high-impact decisions are represented, made, and audited.

---

## 1. High-Impact Decision Definition
A decision is “high-impact” if it affects:
- roster composition or offers
- athlete health/safety risk posture
- recruiting pipeline strategy or evaluations
- season-wide training direction or constraints
- billing, access, or permissions
- program philosophy or declared invariants

---

## 2. Required Decision Structure
High-impact decisions must be representable as:

1) **Decision statement** (what is being decided)  
2) **Context** (why now)  
3) **Options considered** (including “do nothing”)  
4) **Rationale** (why this option)  
5) **Expected outcomes** (intended consequences)  
6) **Risks and mitigations**  
7) **Reversibility** (how to undo; what cannot be undone)  
8) **Owner** (who has authority)  
9) **Timestamp** + relevant season context  

This structure can be stored as institutional memory when needed.

---

## 3. System Support Rules
The system may assist by:
- summarizing context
- surfacing relevant historical precedent
- projecting outcomes where models exist
- highlighting philosophy alignment implications
- highlighting missing information

The system must not:
- fabricate certainty
- hide assumptions
- treat predictions as guarantees

---

## 4. UI Requirements for Decisions
Any decision UI must clearly expose:
- what is changing
- what triggers downstream effects
- whether the change is reversible
- what approvals are required (role-based)

---

## 5. Auditability
Where possible, store a decision record for:
- major recruiting/roster actions
- major season training shifts
- philosophy declaration changes
- permission and billing changes
