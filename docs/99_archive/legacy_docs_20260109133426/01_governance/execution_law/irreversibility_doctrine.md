# Irreversibility Doctrine

Once a system record has crossed a constitutional freeze boundary, it becomes
permanently irreversible.

Irreversible records include:
- Absence determinations
- Program Health evaluations
- Recruiting eligibility determinations
- Scholarship allocations
- Compliance violations
- Billing outcomes

Irreversible records may be audited, referenced, and prospectively appealed.
They may never be edited, overwritten, reframed, or reclassified.
