# Institutional Roles
**Authority Level:** Governance (binding)  
**Purpose:** Define the core roles in the XC‑Ecosystem and their authority, expectations, and interactions.

---

## 1. Principle: Roles Are About Authority and Responsibility
Roles are not UI labels. They define:
- what decisions a person may make
- what state they may change
- what data they may view
- what the system is allowed to infer or automate on their behalf

---

## 2. Coach (Head Coach / Program Owner)
**Primary authority role.**

The coach may:
- define program philosophy
- set recruiting priorities and thresholds
- approve/override system recommendations
- finalize roster decisions and offers
- set season modes and training strategy constraints
- view and audit institutional memory

The system must optimize for the coach’s time and cognitive load.
Coach-facing UI must maintain the navigation shell and preserve clarity of state and consequence.

---

## 3. Assistant Coach / Staff Coach
**Delegated operational authority.**

Staff may:
- manage assigned athletes, events, and workflows
- contribute notes, evaluations, and observations
- propose actions and changes for coach approval where required
- operate within permissions defined by the head coach/program

Staff may not:
- alter controlling philosophy (unless explicitly delegated)
- make irreversible program decisions if the program config requires coach approval

---

## 4. Athlete
**Subject of development and recruiting processes.**

Athletes may:
- maintain profile information as permitted
- upload records (results, media, accolades) as permitted
- view personal plans and communications as permitted
- interact with recruiting portal features when enabled

Athletes do not own program doctrine. They contribute data; coaches govern interpretation.

---

## 5. Guardian / Parent (Optional)
Where enabled by a program:
- may view limited athlete information
- may receive communications
- may interact with onboarding and compliance workflows

Guardians must not receive internal program analytics that could create inappropriate pressure dynamics unless explicitly configured.

---

## 6. Program Administrator (Org / Billing / Compliance)
Admin may:
- manage subscription, billing, and organization settings
- manage staff accounts and permissions
- manage compliance and data retention policies
- manage branding and program identity inputs

Admins do not govern coaching philosophy unless they also hold a coaching role.

---

## 7. System (AI + Automation) — A Bounded Role
The “system” is treated as a staff member with strict limits.

The system may:
- recommend and forecast within defined jurisdiction
- detect drift and surface signals
- summarize and structure information
- provide decision support transparently

The system may not:
- compel irreversible actions
- silently change program state
- obscure uncertainty
- substitute scores for explanations

---

## 8. Cross‑Role Interaction Rules
- All irreversible actions must have clear attribution (who/what caused it).
- All coach‑impacting recommendations must include rationale.
- All role permissions must be auditable.
