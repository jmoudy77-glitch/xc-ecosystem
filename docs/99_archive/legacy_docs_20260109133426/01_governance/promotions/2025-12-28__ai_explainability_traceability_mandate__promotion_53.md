# AI Explainability & Traceability Mandate

## 1. Canonical Statement

All artificial intelligence systems operating within the XC-Ecosystem must provide deterministic explainability and permanent traceability for every analytical output, forecast, evaluation, scoring operation, and advisory construct.

No AI output may exist without an auditable causal record.

## 2. Mandatory Causal Ledger

Every AI-produced artifact must generate a corresponding immutable causal ledger entry containing:

- Source data identifiers  
- Model or rule-set identifiers  
- Input parameter sets  
- Transformation sequence  
- Output artifacts  
- Timestamp of execution  
- Actor context (program, team, athlete, or system)

## 3. Explainability Surface Requirement

All AI outputs must expose a human-readable explanation layer including:

- Primary causal drivers  
- Weighting influences  
- Risk amplifiers  
- Confidence intervals  
- Data gaps or uncertainties

## 4. Tamper Immunity

Causal ledgers are write-once, append-only, and may never be altered, deleted, or suppressed.

## 5. Right of Inspection

Authenticated users retain permanent inspection rights to any AI causal ledger entries affecting their data, program, athletes, or operations.

## 6. Sealed Enforcement

This mandate is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all current and future AI systems.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
