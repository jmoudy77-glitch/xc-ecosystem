# Canonical Domain Closure & Sealed Expansion Boundary Law

## 1. Canonical Statement

All constitutional domains within the XC-Ecosystem are governed by sealed closure boundaries.

No domain may be expanded, merged, subdivided, or deprecated without an explicit Promotion.

## 2. Domain Closure Authority

Each canonical domain is formally closed upon Promotion sealing.

All future changes require explicit constitutional authorization.

## 3. Boundary Enforcement

No feature, automation, or governance rule may implicitly alter domain boundaries.

## 4. Sealed Enforcement

This law is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all constitutional domains.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
