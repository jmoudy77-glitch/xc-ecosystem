# Economic Breach, Fraud Detection & Financial Incident Protocol

## 1. Canonical Statement

The XC-Ecosystem must maintain deterministic fraud detection, breach response, and financial incident containment authority across all economic systems.

No financial anomaly may remain uninvestigated.

## 2. Fraud Surveillance

All economic pipelines must maintain continuous detection for:

- Unauthorized charges  
- Ledger manipulation  
- Routing anomalies  
- Settlement discrepancies  
- Entitlement abuse  

## 3. Mandatory Incident Response

Detected incidents must trigger:

- Immediate containment  
- Human review  
- Ledger isolation  
- Remediation before reinstatement  

## 4. Disclosure Obligation

All financial incidents must be disclosed to impacted parties.

## 5. Sealed Enforcement

This protocol is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all billing and economic systems.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
