# Promotion 17 — Causal Alignment Lock

This promotion permanently seals the causal hierarchy, non-contamination doctrine, and UI separation rules across Program Health (A1), Recruiting, Roster Builder, Performance, and Philosophy Alignment.

## 1) Canonical causal order (sealed)

Program Health (A1) → Recruiting → Roster Builder → Performance  
Philosophy Alignment = audit-only overlay (non-causal, non-blocking)

## 2) Authority declarations (sealed)

### A1 (Program Health)
- Root-causal authority
- Deterministic and forward-only
- Horizon-scoped (H0–H3)
- Non-retroactive
- Non-recommendational
No downstream module may rewrite, override, or “soft-correct” A1 outputs.

### Recruiting
Recruiting is the sole interpreter layer that translates A1 outputs into:
- pipeline targeting and prioritization
- commitment probability and projections
- absence mitigation logic
- offer structure and scholarship planning inputs
Recruiting must consume A1 outputs as canonical fact and may not reinterpret A1.

### Roster Builder
Roster Builder is constructive/assembly-only:
- allocates, assigns, and composes roster structures from recruiting outcomes
Roster Builder may not interpret recruiting analytics or modify recruiting logic.

### Performance
Performance is observational/diagnostic-only:
- measures, trends, compliance, and risk surfacing
Performance must not influence upstream modules and must not produce recruiting or planning recommendations.

### Philosophy Alignment
Philosophy Alignment is immutable, auditable, and non-interventionist:
- may annotate decisions and decision shifts
- may not gate, alter, or override any causal outputs
Philosophy Alignment must never contaminate A1, Recruiting, Roster Builder, or Performance logic.

## 3) UI separation rules (sealed)

UI surfaces must preserve causal separation and may not collapse layers:

- Program Health UI may display A1 states and horizon outputs; must not embed recruiting logic.
- Recruiting UI may display pipeline logic and recruiting actions; must not embed performance diagnostics as causal drivers.
- Roster UI may display roster structures and assignments; must not embed recruiting analytics as roster rules.
- Performance UI may display diagnostics and trends; must not embed upstream planning or recruiting actions.
- Philosophy UI may display audits and annotations; must not present recommendations or gating controls.

## 4) Finalization

No future module, feature, or UI surface may violate this contract.
