# Promotion 27 — Recruiting Commitment Probability Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals commitment probability modeling as a canonical structural function of the Recruiting module.

## 1) Canonical modeling role

Recruiting must generate commitment probability models that:
- are derived from A1 absence context
- incorporate absence mitigation strategies
- are horizon-aware and deterministic

## 2) Structural guarantees

All commitment probability outputs must be:
- attributable to causal inputs
- auditable across A1, Recruiting, and Roster layers

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

Commitment probability modeling may not:
- override A1 absence states
- embed performance diagnostics as modeling drivers
- embed philosophy alignment logic as gating conditions

## 4) Finalization

No future recruiting feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
