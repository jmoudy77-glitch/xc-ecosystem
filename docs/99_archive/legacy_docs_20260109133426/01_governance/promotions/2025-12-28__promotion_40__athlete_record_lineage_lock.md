# Promotion 40 — Athlete Record Lineage Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals lineage requirements for athlete records.

## 1) Canonical lineage

All athlete records must:
- reference a canonical athlete identity root
- preserve lineage to originating causal inputs
- maintain append-only historical continuity

## 2) Structural guarantees

Record lineage must be:
- reconstructable
- auditable
- immutable

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

No module may:
- break lineage chains
- orphan historical athlete records
- collapse record histories

## 4) Finalization

No future feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
