# Program Health UI Contract

This document defines the **non-negotiable UI laws** governing all Program Health interfaces.

---

## 1. Structural Meaning Law

Program Health UI must represent **capability coverage**, not outcomes, judgments, or prescriptions.

- UI expresses presence or absence of structural capabilities
- UI never expresses blame, evaluation, or coaching advice

---

## 2. Non-Prescriptive Law

- No recommendations
- No “what to do” language
- No suggested interventions
- No implied corrective actions

---

## 3. Non-Alarmist Law

- No threat framing
- No color-coded warning semantics
- No urgency cues that imply danger or failure

---

## 4. Horizon Law

All absence presentation must be segmented by deterministic horizons:

- H0 — Immediate / operational
- H1 — Near-term structural
- H2 — Mid-term capability
- H3 — Long-term systemic

---

## 5. Auditability Law

All UI states must map directly to auditable absence engine outputs.

- No derived “opinion layers”
- No opaque scoring transformations

---

## 6. Implementation Binding

All Program Health implementations are required to conform to this contract.
No UI variation may violate these laws.
