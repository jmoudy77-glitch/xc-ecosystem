# Snapshots

This directory contains **factual session records** capturing what was decided, built,
or intentionally deferred during working sessions.

Snapshots are historical records. They are not specifications, laws, or forward-looking
design contracts.

## Purpose

Snapshots preserve:
- decision history
- architectural turning points
- boundaries of completed work
- reasoning endpoints

They exist to prevent the re-litigation of closed design phases.

## Naming Convention

Snapshots must follow:

YYYY-MM-DD__<topic>__snapshot.md

Examples:
- 2025-12-26__brainstorm_modal__snapshot.md
- 2025-12-27__program_health_ui__snapshot.md

## Edit Policy

Snapshots are append-only.
They must never be substantively rewritten.
If a factual correction is required, it must be appended with an explicit correction note.
