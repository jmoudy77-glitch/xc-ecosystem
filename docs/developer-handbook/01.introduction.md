# Developer Handbook — Introduction

Welcome to the **Recruiting Ecosystem Developer Handbook**.

This handbook provides the technical guidance needed to build, maintain, and extend the system. It is written for engineers working on the web application, APIs, database, and AI services that power the ecosystem.

## System Purpose

The Recruiting Ecosystem is a unified platform designed to:

- elevate high school coaching quality
- modernize college recruiting workflows
- centralize athlete development data
- provide AI-assisted decision-making
- integrate billing, roles, and organizational hierarchies

The system spans several domains:

- Recruiting CRM and pipeline intelligence
- Program, roster, and team management
- Athlete development and performance analytics
- High school coaching tools and knowledge base
- AI intelligence layer
- Stripe-based billing and subscriptions

## Core Principles

1. **Reliability** – Features must support real-world, time-sensitive coaching workflows.
2. **Security** – Data access is enforced via Supabase RLS and strict API auth.
3. **Simplicity** – Prefer predictable patterns and clear abstractions over cleverness.
4. **Scalability** – Architecture must support many orgs, teams, and athletes.
5. **Extensibility** – Design modules that can extend to new sports and tools.

## Contributing Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your feature or bugfix.
2. **Implement** changes following the patterns in this handbook.
3. **Run tests and linting** locally.
4. **Open a pull request** with a clear description and screenshots for UI changes.
5. **Request review**, address feedback, and merge only when tests pass.
6. **Update docs** (`/docs/*`) when schema, APIs, or major flows change.

This handbook, together with `system-architecture.md`, `schema.md`, and `api-routes.md`, forms the core of our technical documentation.
