## Canvas-Oriented Plane Evolution Protocol (Program Health)
- Canvas is the working authority surface for Program Health plane decisions.
- Repo docs are the published canonical record.
- Code implements the published record; code is never the origin of geometry decisions.

Every geometry/topology change must follow:
1. Canvas delta entry (append-only)
2. Mirror into `docs/canonical_planes/program_health_plane.md`
3. Code change(s)
4. Single commit containing (2) + (3) + promotion record (if used)
