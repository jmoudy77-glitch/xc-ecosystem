# XC Ecosystem Documentation

Welcome to the XC Ecosystem documentation hub. This site is organized into several major areas:

- **Product** – What the system is, who it serves, and what it does.
- **Architecture** – How the system is built under the hood.
- **Schema** – Database tables, relationships, and migrations.
- **Features** – End-to-end specs for recruiting, rosters, teams, billing, and more.
- **Development** – Handbook for contributors: setup, workflows, and guidelines.
- **UI** – Design system, components, and layout rules.
- **Planning** – Scope, requirements, milestones, and release strategy.

Use this as your starting point when exploring or onboarding into the project.
