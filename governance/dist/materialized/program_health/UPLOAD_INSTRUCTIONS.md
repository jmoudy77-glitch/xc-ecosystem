# Upload Instructions (Project Files)

Goal: make law + ledger searchable as plaintext within the Project.

Upload ALL plaintext files under this folder:
- governance/dist/materialized/program_health/

Minimum required uploads (if you want the smallest set):
- KERNEL_VERSION.md
- MODULE_INDEX.md
- LEDGER.md
- PROJECT_HANDOFF.md
- GENESIS_ALL.md  (single-file searchable corpus)

If folder uploads preserve paths in your UI:
- upload the entire 'genesis/' folder as well (recommended).

After upload:
- delete the inert zip capsules from Project Files (they are not searchable).
