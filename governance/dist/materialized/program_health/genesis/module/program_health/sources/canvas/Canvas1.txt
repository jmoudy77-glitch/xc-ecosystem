# Program Health UI – v0 Constitutional Contract (Path A)

**Status:** Locked for implementation

This document freezes the v0 Program Health UI execution contract so future threads do not redesign or drift.

---

## 1) Constitutional Purpose

Program Health is a runtime instrument — not a dashboard. It renders structural tension, absence voids, and capability drift as a unified system, grounded in truth-bearing data.

This contract defines Path A: a minimal v0 implementation that makes the UI usable and constitutionally aligned.

---

## 2) Non-Negotiable Constraints (v0)

- No dashboard ecology: no cards/panels/tables/graphs in a typical admin layout.
- No companion views, secondary dashboards, or detached analysis pages.
- No “project management” layer inside the instrument.
- The entire UI must remain a single cohesive instrument surface.

---

## 3) Minimal v0 UI Components (Path A)

### 3.1 Instrument Shell
- Program Health route must render as a single instrument with a defined field plane.
- All content lives inside the instrument context.

### 3.2 Capability Drift Map (v0)
- A simplified drift surface that visualizes sector tension distribution.
- No mesh plane, no overlays beyond necessary labeling.
- Must support hover, selection, and a minimal read-ray interaction.

### 3.3 Absence Register (v0)
- Renders absence void determinations as compact cards.
- Cards must be minimally styled, with no dashboard panel framing.
- A card click opens a Health Brief.

### 3.4 Health Brief (v0)
- Displays core determination details and canonical proof.
- Proof must be sourced from canonical events or degrade gracefully if unavailable.
- Must not expand into a multi-page dashboard.

---

## 4) Data Truth Requirements (v0)

- v0 must load the latest snapshot, capability nodes, and absences under RLS.
- Absence determinations must be backed by deterministic provenance.
- All read surfaces must be truth-bearing or explicitly marked as inference.

---

## 5) Interaction Requirements (v0)

- Minimal-touch: low click count, self-evident actions.
- Hover reveals; click confirms; selection is reversible.
- No modal cascades; no nested drilldowns beyond one layer.

---

## 6) Completion Criteria (v0)

v0 is complete when:

* Program Health route loads latest snapshot + absences under RLS.
* Absence Register renders compact cards.
* Clicking a card opens Health Brief.
* Health Brief displays Proof from canonical events (or gracefully degrades if proof unavailable).

No mesh plane, overlays, or doctrine export are required for v0.

This contract is now locked and must not be redesigned in future threads without explicit override.
