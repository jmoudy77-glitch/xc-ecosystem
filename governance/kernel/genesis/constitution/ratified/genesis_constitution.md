# Genesis Constitution (Ratified)

This repository is the sovereign memory plane for Genesis.
Conversation threads are ephemeral IO buffers. Files are canonical.

## Supreme Clauses
1. Law lives in files, not chat.
2. Execution history lives in the ledger, not chat.
3. Promotions are the only lawful mechanism for change.
4. Promotions must be single atomic Codex-executable plaintext streams.
5. Runtime state is derived from registries + ledger, not inference.

## Interpretation
If chat content conflicts with files, files prevail.
If an action is not recorded in the ledger, it did not occur.
