# MB-1 — Program Health Disc Material Constitution

**Status:** Ratified — Locked for implementation

This constitution defines the canonical material and physical semantics of the Program Health disc instrument.

---

## 1) Canonical Material

The disc is **graphite-ice**:
- Matte, dense, dark graphite base
- Subsurface glacial translucence
- Minimal reflectivity
- High mass implication without UI heaviness

---

## 2) Thickness Semantics

Thickness encodes **NOW-weighted tension**:
- Present pressure thickens the disc subtly
- Historical pressure is visible but thinner
- Thickness is not decoration; it is meaning

---

## 3) Rim Behavior

The rim is a structural boundary:
- Rim tension changes must be causally traceable
- Rim glow is permitted only as a meaning-carrying signal
- No neon; no entertainment lighting

---

## 4) Recovery Wave Semantics

Recovery waves express stabilization after a perturbation:
- A wave must always have a cause (event/proof)
- Wave propagation must preserve lineage semantics
- No wave may exist as pure animation

---

## 5) Coach-Legible Diagnostics

All presentation must be coach-legible:
- Avoid academic language
- Prefer structural metaphors: void, pressure, drift, recovery, trace
- Help overlays must be brief and non-patronizing

---

This material constitution is ratified and locked.
