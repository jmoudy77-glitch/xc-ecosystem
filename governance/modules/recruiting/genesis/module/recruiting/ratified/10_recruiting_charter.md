# Recruiting Charter (Ratified)

## 1) Mission (canonical)
Recruiting exists to reduce recruitable program risk by adding athletes that move key roster metrics toward defined target envelopes.

## 2) Boundary (hard)
Recruiting operates exclusively on deficits that can be mitigated by adding athletes.
All other deficits are out of scope for Recruiting and belong to Program Health.

## 3) Hard exclusions (non-negotiable)
Recruiting must not:
- claim to resolve non-recruitable absences (capability, structural, readiness, authority, etc.)
- display non-recruitable absences within Recruiting workflows or summaries
- diagnose or evaluate staff/process/organizational deficiencies
- frame outcomes as certain (“fix,” “solve,” “guarantee”)

## 4) Ownership of recruiting state
Recruiting is a continuous, coach-owned activity.
The system may signal sufficiency conditions but must not declare recruiting complete or terminate recruiting.

## 5) Canonical coach mental model
Recruiting must align to the coach mental model:
“I’m stabilizing my roster for this season.”

Recruiting must emphasize stabilization over completion and must avoid terminal/completion semantics.
