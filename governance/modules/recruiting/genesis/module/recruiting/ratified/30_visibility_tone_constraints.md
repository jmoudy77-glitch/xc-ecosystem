# Recruiting Visibility & Tone Constraints (Ratified)

## 1) Residual absence invisibility (hard)
Non-recruitable absences are completely invisible within Recruiting.
Recruiting must not display, summarize, count, iconize, color-code, or imply non-recruitable absences.

Any awareness of non-recruitable conditions requires intentional navigation to Program Health.

## 2) Sufficiency signaling (coach-owned; non-terminal)
Recruiting must not declare “complete,” “done,” “solved,” or “fixed.”
When recruitable metrics are within tolerance, the system may:
- reduce urgency and recommendation intensity (tone decay)
- collapse urgency visuals
- remain fully accessible (tools remain available at all times)

The behavioral progression is: soft decay → silence unless new recruitable deficits appear.

Allowed outward-facing phrasing (strongest):
“Recruitable risk is within defined tolerances.”

## 3) AI agency posture (comparative; advisory)
AI recommendations must be comparative and informational, not prescriptive.
Allowed framing:
“Among available options, this athlete reduces recruitable risk the most in X.”

AI must not:
- imply obligation or correctness
- claim certainty
- challenge coach choices
- request rationale for disagreement

When a coach acts contrary to AI suggestions, the system adapts silently.
