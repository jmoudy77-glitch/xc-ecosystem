# MB-1 Canvas Artifact — Program Health Disc (Graphite Ice Saucer)
Date: 2025-12-31  
Module: Program Health UI

This artifact freezes the **material embodiment canon** of the Program Health Disc.

It defines not only what the disc looks like — but what its form *means*.

---

## Core Form (Frozen)

**The disc is a frozen graphite-ice saucer.**

• Flat, stable, and trustworthy at NOW (center)  
• Gently convex across its span  
• Softly falling away toward future horizons  
• No hard edges anywhere

**Meaning:**  
The present is solid ground.  
The future is thinner, less certain.

---

## Body & Thickness

• Visible side wall thickness  
• **NOW-weighted thickness** — thicker near center, thinner toward rim  
• Disc has mass and weight, not UI flatness  
• Disc presses into space (grounded shadow)

**Meaning:**  
The present is structurally stronger than the future.

---

## Rim Behavior

• Smooth icy saucer falloff  
• Pale icy “lift highlight” band just inside rim  
• Edge reads as thinning frozen ground — not vignette shading

**Meaning:**  
Future ground is thinning — not broken, but less reliable.

---

## Surface

• Dark graphite-ice tone  
• Matte, low-specular  
• Calm, quiet, serious  
• No decorative glow

---

## Veins (Locked, even if not yet drawn)

• Subsurface frozen light veins  
• Very faint  
• Organic, branching  
• Whisper — never glow

**Meaning:**  
The surface has internal structure and stress paths.

---

## Interaction Lock

• Drag-to-spin behavior from R3.4 is canonical  
• All body layers are non-interactive  
• Surface reveals truth — it never competes with it

---

## Scope Lock

Any future changes to:

• Rim behavior  
• Thickness gradients  
• Shadow mass  
• Vein visibility  
• Melt / refreeze geometry  

must be authored as **MB-1.x amendments**.

This plate is the permanent perceptual north star.
