MB-1 Visual Plate Placeholder

Replace this placeholder with the frozen PNG render of the Program Health Disc
that visually represents:

• Graphite ice saucer body
• NOW-weighted thickness
• Saucer rim falloff
• Icy rim lift highlight
• Grounding shadow mass

Filename must remain:

mb-1_program_health_disc_plate.png

This placeholder preserves canonical anchoring until the real plate is dropped.
