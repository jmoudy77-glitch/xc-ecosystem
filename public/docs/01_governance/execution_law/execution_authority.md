# Execution Authority Law

Execution Authority defines which system layers are legally permitted to
create, finalize, and advance canonical system reality.

Only execution layers may:
- create canonical records
- advance temporal state
- finalize evaluations
- issue irreversible system outcomes

Execution Authority is limited to:
- Program Health Engines
- Performance Engines
- Recruiting Engines
- Compliance Engines
- Billing Engines

UI, AI, visualization, advisory, and reporting layers are expressly prohibited
from possessing execution authority. They may only observe, simulate, and advise.
