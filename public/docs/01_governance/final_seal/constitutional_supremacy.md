# Constitutional Supremacy

The Constitutional Governance Lattice is supreme over:

- application code
- AI systems
- UI and visualization layers
- analytics and reporting
- integrations and partners
- operational workflows
- future system extensions

No system behavior, feature, or implementation may violate constitutional law.
