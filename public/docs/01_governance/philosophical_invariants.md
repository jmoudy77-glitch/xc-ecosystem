# Philosophical Invariants
**Authority Level:** Supreme (subordinate only to the System Constitution)  
**Purpose:** Codify non‑negotiable program philosophy rules so that analysis, AI, and UI remain aligned.

---

## 1. Definition: “Program Philosophy”
Program philosophy is the coach’s declared operating principles—how the program intends to recruit, train, develop, and lead.

It is not branding copy. It is **governing doctrine** that should influence:
- what the system prioritizes
- which warnings matter
- how tradeoffs are explained
- what the coach is reminded of under pressure

---

## 2. Invariants (Must Always Hold)

### 2.1 Coach Sovereignty
The coach remains final authority over philosophy, overrides, and exceptions.
The system may highlight drift; it may not moralize or compel.

### 2.2 Drift is a Signal, Not a Sin
Deviation from philosophy must be treated as useful signal:
- it may indicate shifting constraints (injury, staffing, academics, facilities, weather)
- it may indicate a strategic pivot
- it may indicate emergent risk (overreach, misalignment, burnout)

The system’s job is to surface drift and preserve context—not to punish it.

### 2.3 Philosophy Must Be Interpretable
Philosophy must translate into interpretable rules:
- priorities (what matters most)
- thresholds (what counts as “too much” or “too little”)
- commitments (what the program will protect)
- exceptions (when the program intentionally violates its own defaults)

If philosophy cannot be interpreted, it cannot govern the system.

### 2.4 Performance and Health Must Not Be Contaminated
Performance analytics and Program Health analytics must remain clean:
- They may incorporate philosophy as *context* or *overlay*
- They may not rewrite underlying measurement truth
- Philosophy overlays explain meaning; they do not change what happened

### 2.5 Transparency of Consequence
Whenever philosophy is invoked (by AI or UI), the system must communicate:
- what principle is implicated
- what behavior triggered the implication
- what the predicted consequences are
- what alternatives exist

## 3. Philosophy Representation Model (Canonical)
Philosophy must be represented as a structured entity with:

1) **Core Principles** (non‑negotiables)  
2) **Priorities** (ranked values)  
3) **Operating Defaults** (what the program does “normally”)  
4) **Constraints** (staffing, facilities, travel, academics)  
5) **Approved Exceptions** (allowed deviations and why)  
6) **Seasonal Mode** (in‑season vs off‑season priorities)  

This representation is mandatory for any module claiming “philosophy alignment.”

---

## 4. Drift Detection (Allowed System Behavior)
The system may detect drift when observed behavior diverges from declared defaults.

Drift detection must:
- be explainable
- be reversible (coach can dismiss or accept)
- preserve context (“why we did this”) as institutional memory
- never be silent in a way that changes system state

Drift detection may be surfaced in:
- Program Health (strategic misalignment risk)
- Performance (decision overlays and tradeoffs)
- Recruiting (pipeline choices vs stated values)
- UI (lightweight cues; never noisy nagging)

---

## 5. Institutional Memory of Philosophy
The system must preserve:
- declared philosophy versions over time
- notable deviations and rationales
- season mode shifts
- staff changes that correlate with philosophy shifts

This prevents “rewriting history” and supports long‑term program integrity.

---

## 6. Practical Coach Promise
The platform must behave like a trusted staff member:
- faithful to the coach’s intent
- honest about tradeoffs
- direct but not dramatic
- transparent and never silent
