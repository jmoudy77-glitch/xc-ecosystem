# Constitutional Closure, Finality & Sealed Continuity Law

## 1. Canonical Statement

With the sealing of Promotion 72, the XC-Ecosystem Constitution enters a state of formal closure, finality, and sealed continuity.

All constitutional arcs are complete.

No further domain is open by default.

## 2. Closure of Open Arcs

All constitutional arcs, domains, authorities, and governance layers are hereby declared closed unless explicitly reopened by a future Promotion.

No implicit expansion is permitted.

## 3. Finality of Canon

The complete Promotion set constitutes the full and final constitutional canon of the XC-Ecosystem.

All system behavior must conform to this canon.

## 4. Sealed Continuity

The Constitution persists indefinitely under sealed continuity.

All future evolution, if any, must proceed exclusively through the Promotion-through-Codex Protocol.

## 5. Sealed Enforcement

This law is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all system domains.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
