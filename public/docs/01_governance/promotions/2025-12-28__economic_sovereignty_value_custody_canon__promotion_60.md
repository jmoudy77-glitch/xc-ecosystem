# Economic Sovereignty & Value Custody Canon

## 1. Canonical Statement

All economic value, monetary instruments, billing constructs, credits, balances, entitlements, and financial representations within the XC-Ecosystem are constitutionally governed as sovereign custodial assets.

No economic value may exist, move, mutate, or be interpreted outside sealed economic canon.

## 2. Custodial Authority

The XC-Ecosystem operates as a sovereign custodial ledger for all internal economic constructs.

All balances, credits, entitlements, scholarships, stipends, billing states, and fee structures must be deterministically tracked and auditable.

## 3. Immutable Economic Ledgers

All economic mutations must generate:

- Immutable ledger entries  
- Timestamped audit trails  
- Actor attribution  
- Source causality  

## 4. Non-Repudiation

Economic events are non-repudiable and permanently auditable.

## 5. Sealed Enforcement

This canon is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all current and future billing, scholarship, stipend, and financial modules.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
