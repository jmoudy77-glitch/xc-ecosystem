# Payment Processing, Settlement & Reconciliation Law

## 1. Canonical Statement

All payment processing, settlement, and financial reconciliation within the XC-Ecosystem must operate under sealed deterministic governance.

No monetary settlement may occur without canonical ledger causality.

## 2. Settlement Ledger Requirement

Every payment event must generate immutable settlement records including:

- External processor reference  
- Internal ledger correlation ID  
- Amount  
- Currency  
- Settlement status  
- Timestamp  

## 3. Reconciliation Mandate

All external payment processor balances must be continuously reconciled against internal sovereign ledgers.

Discrepancies must trigger mandatory investigation and remediation.

## 4. Non-Bypassability

No automation or integration may bypass settlement and reconciliation governance.

## 5. Sealed Enforcement

This law is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all payment processing modules.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
