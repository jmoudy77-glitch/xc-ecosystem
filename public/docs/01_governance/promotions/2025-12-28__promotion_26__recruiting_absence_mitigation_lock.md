# Promotion 26 — Recruiting Absence Mitigation Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals absence mitigation logic as a canonical structural function of the Recruiting module.

## 1) Canonical mitigation role

Recruiting must derive absence mitigation strategies directly from A1 absence outputs.

Mitigation owns:
- pipeline rebalancing
- targeting prioritization
- offer adjustment logic
- commitment probability recalibration

## 2) Structural guarantees

All mitigation logic must be:
- attributable to specific A1 absence states
- deterministic and auditable
- horizon-aware

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

Mitigation may not:
- override A1 absence states
- embed performance diagnostics as mitigation drivers
- embed philosophy alignment logic as gating conditions

## 4) Finalization

No future recruiting feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
