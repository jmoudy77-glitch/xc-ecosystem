# Promotion 33 — Compliance Execution Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals compliance execution as a canonical execution-layer function.

## 1) Canonical compliance execution role

Compliance execution owns:
- eligibility enforcement
- rule conformity validation
- audit response logging
- infraction and remediation tracking

## 2) Structural guarantees

All compliance execution records must be:
- attributable to coach action logs
- timestamped and immutable
- auditable against roster, recruiting, and performance layers

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

Compliance execution may not:
- embed recruiting logic
- embed performance diagnostics as causal drivers
- issue recommendations

## 4) Finalization

No future compliance feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
