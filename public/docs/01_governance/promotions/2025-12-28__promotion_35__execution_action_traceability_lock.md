# Promotion 35 — Execution Action Traceability Canonical Lock

This promotion permanently seals cross-execution-layer traceability as a canonical structural requirement.

## 1) Canonical traceability role

All execution-layer actions must be traceable across:
- coach action logs
- practice execution
- meet operations
- compliance execution
- notification execution

## 2) Structural guarantees

Traceability must:
- preserve causal chain continuity
- allow full reconstruction of execution flows
- remain immutable and auditable

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

No execution-layer feature may:
- break causal traceability
- suppress or fork execution histories
- create unverifiable execution actions

## 4) Finalization

No future execution feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
