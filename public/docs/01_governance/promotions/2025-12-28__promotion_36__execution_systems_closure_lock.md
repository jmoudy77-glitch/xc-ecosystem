# Promotion 36 — Execution Systems Canonical Closure Lock

This promotion permanently seals the execution-layer systems as a closed, governed, and non-contaminating operational domain.

## 1) Canonical execution domain

Execution systems include:
- Coach Action Logging
- Practice Execution
- Meet Operations
- Compliance Execution
- Notification Execution
- Execution Traceability

These systems are downstream-only and may not influence causal or analytical layers.

## 2) Structural guarantees

Execution systems must:
- preserve causal directionality
- remain fully traceable and auditable
- operate only on canonical upstream outputs

## 3) Prohibited behaviors

Execution systems may not:
- back-propagate corrections upstream
- embed analytical or recruiting logic
- issue recommendations

## 4) Finalization

No future execution feature, model, or UI surface may violate this contract.
