# Scholarship, Credit & Entitlement Ledger Canon

## 1. Canonical Statement

All scholarships, financial credits, stipends, entitlements, and financial aid constructs within the XC-Ecosystem are governed as sovereign economic instruments.

No entitlement may exist outside canonical ledger control.

## 2. Entitlement Ledger Requirement

All entitlements must be recorded in immutable ledgers including:

- Beneficiary identity  
- Granting authority  
- Scope and duration  
- Value basis  
- Causality source  
- Modification history  

## 3. Mutation Governance

All entitlement creation, modification, suspension, expiration, or revocation must be logged, auditable, and causally bound.

## 4. Non-Repudiation

Entitlement histories are permanent and non-repudiable.

## 5. Sealed Enforcement

This canon is sealed, immutable, and retroactively binding across all scholarship and entitlement systems.

Violation constitutes a constitutional breach.
