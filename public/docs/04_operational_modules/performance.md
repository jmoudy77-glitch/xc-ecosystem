# Performance

## Purpose
Describe the user-facing capabilities, workflows, and integration points for this module.

## Scope
Defines what the module does and what it depends on. Does not redefine governance or architecture.

## Authoritative statements
- This module must comply with `01_governance/*` and `02_architecture/module_boundaries.md`.
- Performance must not be contaminated by philosophy alignment logic unless explicitly specified and governed.

## Primary workflows
- Key flows should be implemented as minimal-touch, coach-intuitive interactions.
- Use drag-and-drop where feasible for high-frequency tasks.

## Data and integration points
- Source-of-truth entities and states are defined in `03_domain_models/*`.
- Persisted outputs must be auditable when derived.
