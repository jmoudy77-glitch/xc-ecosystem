# AI Systems Index
**Authority Level:** AI Systems Index (informational)  
**Purpose:** Map the governed AI subsystems in XC-Ecosystem and define how they attach to operational modules.

---

## Precedence
All AI behavior is subordinate to:
- `01_governance/system_constitution.md`
- `01_governance/philosophical_invariants.md`
- `01_governance/decision_protocol.md`
- `02_architecture/*` (module boundaries, data authority, data flow)

AI system docs define *jurisdiction*, not new authority.

---

## Canonical AI Systems
1. `ai_authority_charter.md` — platform-wide AI permission + prohibition charter (controlling for all AI)
2. `scout_score.md` — recruiting evaluation score + rationale (derived analytics)
3. `commit_probability.md` — conversion forecast for a recruit (derived analytics)
4. `pipeline_projection.md` — cohort gap and pipeline-to-roster forecast (derived analytics)
5. `absence_engine.md` — attendance/engagement anomaly detection (derived analytics attached to Program Health)

---

## Shared AI contracts
- `confidence_semantics.md` — how uncertainty is represented consistently across AI outputs
- `ai_output_record_contract.md` — required fields for any persisted AI output (auditability + provenance)

---

## Coach promise
AI in XC-Ecosystem behaves like a bounded staff member:
- transparent about why it is saying something
- honest about uncertainty
- never silently changes source-of-truth state
- always leaves final authority with the coach
