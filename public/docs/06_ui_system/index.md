# UI System Index
**Authority Level:** UI System Index (informational)  
**Purpose:** Map the coach-facing UI laws that govern every program surface, workflow, and component.

---

## Precedence
All UI surfaces are subordinate to:
- `01_governance/*` (coach sovereignty, clarity, reversibility)
- `02_architecture/*` (module boundaries, data authority, causality transparency)
- `03_domain_models/*` (meaning of entities and states)
- `05_ai_systems/*` (AI charter + confidence semantics)

UI System Law is controlling over component implementations and page layouts.

## Canonical UI System Lawbooks
1. `ui_philosophy.md` — interaction philosophy and coach cognition alignment
2. `layout_rules.md` — non-negotiable layout and shell requirements
3. `navigation_ia.md` — information architecture and navigation patterns
4. `interaction_contracts.md` — component/workflow interaction contracts (drag, modals, reversibility)
5. `branding_theme_system.md` — branding + semantic theme token system
6. `ui_intuition_checklist.md` — standard checklist used to validate every coach-facing surface
7. `ai_ui_guidelines.md` — rules for presenting AI outputs (labels, provenance, uncertainty)

## Coach promise (what “good” looks like)
A coach should feel:
- oriented immediately (where am I, what can I do)
- relief from tool fragmentation (the system carries structure)
- confidence in consequences (what happens if I click, can I undo)
- clarity under pressure (today’s priorities are surfaced without noise)
