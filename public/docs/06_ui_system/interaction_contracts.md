# Interaction Contracts

## Purpose
Define behavioral contracts for key interactions so components remain consistent.

## Authoritative statements
- Drag-and-drop is preferred where it reduces steps (e.g., assigning events to practices).
- Complex flows must surface reversibility (undo/remove) and clear consequence previews.
- For Practice Builder: AddPracticeDialogTrigger opens a large centered PracticeBuilderModal; Individual Assignments control lives in Group Assignments header; individual panel slides between groups panel and library.
