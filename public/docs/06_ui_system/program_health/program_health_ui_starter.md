# Program Health UI — Discussion Starter & Context Brief

**Purpose of this document**  
This document is intended to be pasted verbatim at the start of a **new Program Health UI discussion thread**.

Its role is to transfer the full conceptual, architectural, and philosophical context accumulated so far, so that UI decisions:
- do not reopen settled questions,
- do not drift into prescriptive or alarmist design,
- and remain faithful to the A1 Absence Engine.

This is a **UI discussion starter**, not a system redesign prompt.

## 1. What Is Locked (Do Not Revisit)

Before discussing UI, assume the following are fully locked and correct:

### 1.1 A1 Absence Engine
- Absence = **loss of capability**, not loss of people
- Absences are deterministic, forward-looking, and auditable
- Absences are never recommendations
- Absences are never retroactively rewritten
- Absences are evaluated per horizon (H0–H3)

### 1.2 Sport-Specific Configuration
- **XC** uses program-level tiering (Competitive / Elite)
- **T&F** does **not** use program-level tiering. All Track & Field programs are evaluated using uniform baseline capability expectations independent of program classification.

## 2. What Program Health Is (UI Meaning)

Program Health UI expresses **capability coverage over time**, not outcomes, opinions, or judgments.

It answers only:
- “What capabilities are present or absent?”
- “At what horizons do those absences manifest?”
- “How do those absences evolve forward in time?”

It does not answer:
- “What should I do?”
- “Is this good or bad?”
- “Who caused this?”
- “What is the solution?”

## 3. Non-Alarmist Presentation Rules

- No color-coded threat, warning, or scoring semantics
- No recommendation language
- No implied corrective framing
- No “alerts” in the behavioral sense

Absence presentation must remain factual, structural, and temporally grounded.

## 4. Horizon Semantics

- **H0** — Immediate / current operational horizon  
- **H1** — Near-term structural horizon  
- **H2** — Mid-term capability horizon  
- **H3** — Long-term systemic horizon  

Each horizon expresses deterministic forward capability coverage, not outcomes or predictions of success/failure.
