# Archive Index
**Authority Level:** Archive Index (informational)  
**Purpose:** Preserve legacy / source documents for traceability without polluting canonical system doctrine.

---

## What this folder is
The archive is a **non-canonical** holding area for:
- legacy drafts
- exploratory notes
- historical snapshots
- pre-consolidation specifications
- source material that has been merged into canonical docs

Archive documents may contain valuable ideas, but they are **not authoritative** unless their content has been consolidated into the numbered canonical sections (`01_*` through `07_*`).

---

## How to use the archive
Use archive documents to:
- trace a decision back to its origin
- understand earlier versions of concepts
- recover a detail that was intentionally consolidated elsewhere
- support audits of “why we did it this way”

Do **not** cite archive docs as governing rules in active implementation. Use canonical lawbooks instead.
