# Permissions Matrix

Define roles and their permissions across features.

Example roles:
- System Admin

- Head Coach
- Assistant Coach
- Graduate Assistant
- Volunteer Coach
- Director of Operations
- Athlete

For each feature area (roster, recruiting, team ops, results, billing), define read/write/manage permissions per role.
