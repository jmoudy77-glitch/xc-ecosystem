# Performance Module — Actionable Clarity
## Session Snapshot & Architectural Contract

**Status:** Locked (UI scaffolding + cognitive model finalized)  
**Audience:** Coaches, Product, Engineering  
**Purpose:** Preserve decisions, intent, and boundaries reached in this session

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Performance module has finalized its identity as a **process that delivers actionable clarity**, not merely a reporting surface.

What began as an analytical layer (primes, rollups, scores) evolved into a **cognitive transition system** that intentionally guides a coach through:

1. Orientation
2. Recognition of imbalance
3. Cognitive engagement
4. Interpretation
5. Transition to action

Performance does not replace coaching judgment.  
It **prepares the coach to exercise it well**.

---

## 2. Core Definition

**Performance is the present-tense expression of a competitive system.**

It answers:
> “How well is my competitive system functioning right now?”

It does **not** answer:
- Is my program sustainable long-term?
- Is recruiting healthy?
- Are administrative systems aligned?

Those belong to the **Program module**, which is now explicitly separate.

---

## 3. Finalized Separation: Program vs Performance

### Performance Module Owns:
- Competitive equilibrium
- Execution tension
- Athlete trajectory (expressed as health)
- Team-level performance balance
- Near-term readiness vs strain

### Program Module Owns:
- Long-range health
- Sustainability
- Recruiting pipeline
- Administrative and projection-based decisions

**Performance is the symptom surface.  
Program is the cause surface.**

This separation is now locked.

---

## 4. The Performance Loop (Five Elements)

The Performance module operates as a closed loop:

### 1. Orientation (The Map)
A visual, non-numerical entry point that mirrors how coaches *feel* imbalance before they articulate it.

### 2. Balance Recognition
Imbalance is perceived as **familiar discomfort**, not alarm.
No red dashboards. No panic states.

### 3. Cognitive Engagement
The coach begins asking *why* organically, without being prompted by text.

### 4. Interpretation (Program / Team Brief)
Narrative explanation that contextualizes what the coach is seeing.
No prescriptions yet.

### 5. Action Translation (Brainstorm)
Abstract insight is converted back into concrete decisions.
Liquid becomes solid.

---

## 5. Entry Page UI: The Map

### Purpose
The entry page is a **single map** that orients the coach to both:
- Competitive system balance
- Individual athlete health

### Structure

#### A. Program Balance Panel (Top)
- Five **glassy liquid globs**
- Each represents a competitive tension
- Equilibrium = spherical
- Imbalance = mass shifts toward one pole

**Five Locked Dichotomies:**

- Training Load ↔ Competitive Readiness  
- Individual Development ↔ Team Performance  
- Consistency ↔ Adaptation  
- Program Discipline ↔ Competitive Instinct  
- Sustainability ↔ Pressure  

Imbalance is shown through **form and light**, not numbers.

---

#### B. Athlete Health Strip (Bottom)
- One orb per athlete
- Orb color represents trajectory-based health:
  - Green: improving
  - Yellow: plateau
  - Red: declining

Trajectory is **computed**, not displayed.

---

## 6. Visual Language Principles

- No charts at entry
- No numbers at entry
- No labels that require explanation

Visuals must:
- Feel physical
- Feel familiar
- Feel interpretable without instruction

Imbalance should be *felt*, not decoded.

---

## 7. Interaction Model

### Globs
- **Hover popovers only**
- Brief, contextual, intermediate
- Explicitly non-final

Popover language directs coaches forward:
> “Understand how this impacts your program in the Program Brief.”

---

### Equilibrium Statement Panel
- Centered beneath the map
- Single composite statement only:
  - “Your competitive system appears to be in equilibrium.”
  - “Something appears to be pulling your competitive system out of equilibrium.”

- Entire panel is clickable
- CTA language:
  > “Click here to enter the Program Brief”

This ensures **top-to-bottom cognitive flow**.

---

## 8. Program / Team Brief Modal

### Role
The Brief is a **translation layer**, not a decision engine.

### Characteristics
- Modal (intentional transition)
- Two synchronized toggles:
  - Program ↔ Team
  - Season ↔ 3-Year lens
- Narrative-first
- No optimization yet

### Purpose
To prepare the coach to **act intelligently**, not reflexively.

---

## 9. Brainstorm (Deferred but Central)

Brainstorm is the **completion of the loop**.

Performance without Brainstorm is incomplete.

Brainstorm:
- Converts abstract understanding into action
- Grounds the coach back in implementation reality
- Is not optional in the long term

---

## 10. What Is Explicitly Not Included (By Design)

- Threshold controls for coaches
- Per-glob prescriptions at entry
- Early drill-down via clicking globs
- Red/green alarm semantics
- “Fix this now” messaging

These were intentionally excluded.

---

## 11. Status at End of Session

### Locked
- Cognitive model
- Program vs Performance separation
- Entry map structure
- Dichotomies
- Interaction flow
- Modal architecture

### Intentionally Deferred
- Final glob physics
- Exact color math
- Brainstorm implementation
- Program module UI

---

## 12. Final Statement

The Performance module is not a dashboard.

It is a **guided cognitive system** that respects how coaches actually think:
visually first, abstractly second, operationally last.

This session finalized that identity.
