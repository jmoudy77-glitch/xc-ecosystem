# Universal Seeding Strategy – Database Foundation

## Goal
Solve the two-sided marketplace issue by **pre-populating the database** without requiring early coach signups.

## Method
- Build a universal athlete seed layer from:
  - Public TFRRS/Milesplit data (legally accessible exports)
  - School directories  
  - Existing roster information  
- Each athlete record tagged with:
  - Performance markers  
  - Academic placeholders  
  - School mapping  

## Benefits
- Coaches onboard in minutes — no data entry  
- Recruit boards have instant value  
- AI models have baseline data for scoring
