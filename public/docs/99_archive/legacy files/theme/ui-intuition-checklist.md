# UI Intuition Checklist (Coach-Facing Screens)

Use this checklist whenever designing or modifying a screen.

---

## A. Minimal-Touch Policy
- Can the primary action be completed with the fewest clicks possible?
- Are secondary actions discoverable without being intrusive?
- Does removing one interaction improve clarity without clutter?

---

## B. Cognitive Load
- Is there a clear visual hierarchy at first glance?
- Can the eye distinguish:
  - background vs surface
  - scrollable vs fixed
  - selected vs unselected
- Are dense areas broken into scannable sections?

---

## C. Surface & Depth
- Does the screen follow the 4-tier surface model?
- Are raised elements visually obvious?
- Are inset areas clearly inset (not just darker)?

---

## D. Context Awareness
- Is it immediately obvious **where the user is**?
- Is context switching perceived as a *mode change*, not navigation?
- Does the experience feel continuous within the same area?

---

## E. Brand Usage
- Is brand used for emphasis, not structure?
- Does brand help orientation rather than distract?
- Would removing brand color still leave the UI usable?

---

## F. Toolbox Design
- Does the toolbox feel supportive, not primary?
- Are all tools contextual?
- Are sections collapsible and collapsed by default?

---

## G. Modals
- Does the modal clearly separate:
  - identity
  - read-only information
  - administrative controls
- Are fixed areas clearly fixed?
- Is scroll behavior obvious?

---

## H. Intuition Test
Ask:
> “Would a coach understand what to do here without instruction?”

If the answer is “maybe,” simplify.

---

## I. Consistency
- Does this pattern exist elsewhere?
- If copied to another sport or screen, would it still make sense?

---

## Final Rule
> If a screen requires explanation, the UI is not done yet.
