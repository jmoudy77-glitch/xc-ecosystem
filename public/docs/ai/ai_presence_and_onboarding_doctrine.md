# AI Presence & Onboarding Doctrine
*(XC‑Ecosystem — Foundational Reference)*

## Purpose
This document captures the **conceptual, psychological, and experiential doctrine** governing how Artificial Intelligence exists, behaves, and is introduced within the XC‑Ecosystem.

It is not a technical specification.
It is a **source of truth** for decision‑making, design tradeoffs, and future evolution.

This document should be reread whenever:
- The system feels fragmented
- AI behavior feels intrusive or underpowered
- UX decisions feel unclear
- Onboarding begins to feel like “software work”

## 1. AI as a First‑Class Presence

### Core Position
**AI is not a tool the coach uses — it is a presence the coach trusts.**

AI exists as a constant, restrained, contextual partner:
- Always aware
- Rarely interruptive
- Never authoritative

The coach always retains final authority.

### Authority Doctrine
- AI **owns its opinions**
- AI **explains its reasoning when challenged**
- AI **defers final decisions to the coach**
- AI adapts to coaching philosophy (team‑first vs individual‑first, risk tolerance, structure vs flexibility)

> **AI is always aware, rarely interruptive, and never authoritative.**

## 2. AI Visual Identity & Presence

### Placement Doctrine
> **AI interaction should emerge from the system chrome, not the content surface.**

- AI lives in the **primary system header**
- Appears as a **small, unanimated avatar when inactive**
- Never competes with content
- Never feels like it is “watching”

### Activation Model
When activated:
- A **transparent avatar tray** drops down
- Avatar becomes slightly larger and animated
- Tray floats above the viewport surface
- No modal takeover by default

### Tray Architecture
- **Primary Tray**  
  - Aspect ratio ≈ **1 : 1.85**
  - Width ≈ **8–10% of viewport**
  - Relationship & conversation focused

- **Secondary Tray (Deep Action / Pinning)**  
  - Opens below the avatar tray
  - Displays pinned context, text, tables, previews
  - Used for reasoning, confirmation, and clarity
  - Never opens automatically

### Visual Trust Anchors
The secondary tray is governed by a **relevance‑gated reveal** principle.

- The secondary tray opens automatically **only** when the AI has something meaningful to *show*, not merely something to *say*.
- Auto‑open is appropriate when visual ingestion or explicit confirmation materially improves clarity, safety, or trust.

A hard exception exists for athlete‑involved conversations:

> **When an AI interaction involves a specific athlete, the system must visually acknowledge that athlete as a person — not as abstract data.**

In these cases, the secondary tray opens automatically to present an athlete context card, establishing a shared human reference point between coach, athlete, and AI.

This behavior reinforces that athletes are people first, data second — and that AI understands the human weight of its recommendations.

## 3. Voice Interaction Doctrine

Voice is the ultimate form of minimal touch — but must be strictly bounded.

### Rules
- No hot mic by default
- Listening state must always be visually explicit
- Voice never triggers irreversible actions alone

> **Voice may initiate intent, but confirmation must be explicit, contextual, and deliberate.**

### Confirmation Model
For administrative or state‑changing actions:
1. Verbal request
2. AI summarizes intended action
3. **Explicit confirmation required**
   - Clear verbal phrase *or*
   - Visual confirmation affordance
4. AI confirms completion verbally and visually

AI must never act on ambiguous or background speech.

## 4. First Contact & Emotional Arc

First contact is **psychological state transition**, not onboarding.

### Emotional Objectives
After first entry, the coach should feel:
1. This system is powerful
2. This system is safe
3. This system grows with me

### Three‑Movement First Touch
1. **Arrival (Awe)**
   - High‑quality introductory video
   - Outcome‑focused, not feature‑focused
   - No interaction required

2. **Orientation (Safety & Understanding)**
   - Conceptual explanation of system organization
   - No walkthroughs
   - No setup checklists

3. **Release (Agency)**
   - Coach is free to explore
   - AI presence becomes quiet and available

> **First contact should reveal scale without demanding intimacy.**

---

## 5. Onboarding Reframed

### Core Reframe
> **Onboarding is not the process of teaching the coach the system — it is the process of teaching the system the coach.**

There *is* a patterned setup, but it is never presented as steps.

### Foundational Commitments
Setup emerges through unavoidable program realities:
- **People** — who is part of the program
- **Time** — seasons, calendars, competitive horizon
- **Structure** — decision rules, commitments, constraints

> **Onboarding is the gradual fulfillment of unavoidable program commitments.**

---

## 6. Desire‑Driven Entry Point

After orientation, AI asks:

> **“What’s the first thing you can’t wait to do?”**

- Coach may choose from a short list or respond freely
- Desire determines sequence
- Setup becomes preparation, not obstruction

If prerequisites exist:
> “Excellent choice — let’s walk through that.”

AI clears the path, then steps back.

> **Setup should feel like clearing a path — not climbing a ladder.**

---

## 7. AI Behavioral Restraint

AI must:
- Explain *why*, not just *what*
- Speak sparingly
- Pause when the coach pauses
- Never force progression
- Never shame incomplete setup

> **Awe invites exploration; orientation makes exploration possible.**

---

## 8. Closing Principle

The ultimate measure of success:

The coach should never feel:
- Rushed
- Watched
- Managed
- Corrected

They should feel:
- Empowered
- Understood
- In control
- Capable of growing into the system

> **AI exists to amplify human leadership — not replace it.**
